# The Eternal Campaign Circuit

Okay, here's the thing nobody's telling you about the indie comic scene on the outer stations—it's not about comics anymore. It's about campaigns.

I've been watching this phenomenon spread through the creative underground like spore contamination, and honestly? It's getting weird out there. Artists who used to drop one killer project every few years are now running simultaneous funding drives for their "universe prequels," "red extermination editions," and whatever merchandise tie-in they dreamed up this cycle.

## The Subscription Artist Economy

Take someone like エザン・ヴァン・スカイバー, the guy behind CYBER-KAERU (that's right, Cyber Frog for you Core System types). Dude went from underground comic rebel to... what exactly? A one-person crowdfunding industrial complex?

Right now—and I checked this morning—he's running funding campaigns for:
- CYBER-KAERU 3: Red Extermination
- The entire Cyber-Kaeru Universe Prequels collection
- 2936 merchandise line (because apparently we need branded space-socks)
- And something called "Ultra Cyber-Kaeru: Warts and All"

Let me show you how this actually works. The artist builds a following around creative independence—"I don't need the mega-corps!" Then they discover they can make more credits managing eternal funding cycles than actually creating. The audience becomes the product. The campaigns become the content.

## The Ko-Fi Trap

Here's where it gets really interesting. These creators have turned their live-streams into tip jars. "Send a Ko-Fi tip!" becomes the opening line of every broadcast. What started as "support independent art" morphs into "subsidize my lifestyle while I talk about making art."

I've watched creators spend three hours streaming about cover concepts and zero hours actually drawing. The performance of creation becomes more profitable than creation itself.

## When Independence Becomes Dependency

The cruel irony? These artists achieved exactly what they wanted—total creative freedom from corporate interference. But they traded corporate bosses for something potentially worse: an audience that expects constant feeding.

Every project needs a prequel. Every story needs expanded universe potential. Every campaign needs stretch goals that spawn the next campaign. The "independent" artist becomes more beholden to audience demands than any studio executive ever made them.

## The Real Story

Look, I'm not saying crowdfunding is evil—I've backed plenty of brilliant projects that couldn't exist otherwise. But when I see the same creator running four simultaneous campaigns while livestreaming about how much they need "just a little more support," something's broken.

The most successful indie comics still come from artists who disappear for two years, make something incredible, then emerge with their hands full of actual art. The endless campaigners? They're optimizing for engagement, not excellence.

And HERE'S where it gets interesting—their audiences are starting to notice. Comment sections fill with "Remember when you used to make comics?" The subscription gets tired. The spell breaks.

You're gonna want to remember this pattern, because it's spreading beyond comics. Musicians, game developers, even food critics are getting trapped in the eternal campaign cycle.

Maybe true independence means knowing when to stop asking.
