# Earth Council Chairman Gets Sol System Energy Prices Spectacularly Wrong

準備された演説で基本的な事実を間違える

Look, I get it. When you're talking to reporters in the hallway or answering questions on the fly, numbers get fuzzy. Brain goes blank. Happens to the best of us.

But during last cycle's State of the Systems address—you know, the *prepared* speech that gets transmitted to every inhabited world in the galaxy—Earth Unified Council Chairman somehow managed to claim hydrogen fuel costs 47 Standard Galactic Credits per metric ton.

Actual price at Ceres Exchange yesterday? 94 SGC.

I just think it's funny that someone wrote this down. Someone else fact-checked it. A third person loaded it into the teleprompter. And nobody thought to, I don't know, check the most basic economic data point affecting every single person listening?

The Chairman's office issued a correction three hours later, buried in a routine energy policy update. "Clerical error," they called it. Sure. The kind of clerical error that makes your energy policy sound twice as successful as it actually is.

Wait, it gets better.

Turns out this wasn't even the first time. I pulled the archives from his last five major addresses:

- Claimed rare element mining was up 23% (actually down 8%)
- Said unemployment in the Outer Rim was "the lowest in generations" (it hit a 50-year high that quarter)
- Announced "record-breaking" trade surplus with Alpha Centauri (we had a 2.3 trillion SGC deficit)

Each time: prepared remarks, full staff review, beamed across the solar system to billions of people.

I called the Council's Press Secretary to ask about their fact-checking process. Got put on hold for forty-seven minutes, then disconnected. When I called back, they said the Press Secretary was "in meetings" for the rest of the cycle.

Their statement, delivered via automated message: "The Chairman misspoke. These minor numerical discrepancies don't affect the overall strength of his policy positions."

Minor numerical discrepancies. That's what we're calling "being wrong by exactly 100%" now.

Here's what kills me—this isn't some esoteric budget line item buried in subsection 47-B of the Colonial Development Fund. This is *energy prices*. The thing every single person in the solar system pays for every single day. You might as well claim gravity costs 12 SGC per kilogram.

But sure, clerical error. And nobody laughed?

I'm not saying they're deliberately misleading anyone. I'm just reading their numbers aloud and watching them not match reality. Weird coincidence how the "errors" always make things sound better than they are, though.

Anyway, hydrogen's still 94 SGC a ton. In case anyone was wondering what actual numbers look like.
