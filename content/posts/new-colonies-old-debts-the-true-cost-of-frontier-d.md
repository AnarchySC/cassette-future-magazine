# New Colonies, Old Debts: The True Cost of Frontier Development

*辺境開発の真の代価を追跡する*

Kepler-442b received its "development assistance" package last quarter. The Earth Unified Council press release highlighted 50 million Standard Galactic Credits in infrastructure loans, technical expertise, and "partnership opportunities." Governor Sarah Chen called it "a new dawn for frontier prosperity."

That's one version of events.

The actual manifest tells a different story. Those infrastructure loans carry compound interest at 12% annually, secured against the colony's mineral extraction rights. The "technical expertise" comes with mandatory procurement contracts—all equipment must be sourced through Earth-certified suppliers at premium rates. Colony fabrication rights are suspended for the loan duration.

The math is straightforward. Kepler-442b produces approximately 2,000 tons of rare earth elements monthly, current market value 847 SGC per ton. Total monthly output: 1.7 million credits. Monthly debt service on the development package: 1.2 million credits.

Meanwhile, the colony's population has grown 300% since the deal was signed. Food, housing, and life support costs have increased accordingly. Basic necessities now consume 600,000 credits monthly. The remaining 500,000 credits barely covers operational expenses.

"We're running a surplus," Governor Chen told me during our neural-link interview. "The partnership model is working."

I asked about the colony's request to purchase fabrication equipment from Tau Ceti Industries—30% cheaper than Earth suppliers. Chen's pause lasted four seconds. "We honor our commitments," she said.

Free, they said. I checked the fine print.

The development package includes a "stability clause." If payments fall behind, Earth reserves the right to deploy "administrative oversight" to ensure "fiscal responsibility." Translation: if you can't make payments, we take over operations.

Three systems tried to renegotiate similar arrangements in the past decade. Vega-7 declared independence. The Solar Defense Compact intervened within six months to "restore order." The colony now operates under direct Earth administration.

Proxima Centauri attempted partial default, citing emergency food shortages. Earth offered emergency relief—at 18% interest, secured against population centers. Today, 40% of Proxima's workforce serves Earth contracts under "voluntary relocation programs."

Ross-128b simply stopped making payments. Officially, they experienced "critical systems failure." The salvage operation recovered significant mineral deposits. Coincidentally.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce a loan agreement across 20 light-years of space. The Galactic Central Bank's enforcement division reported operating expenses of 2.3 billion credits last fiscal quarter. Their collection rate: 97.4%.

The new colonies keep signing. The terms keep getting better—for someone.

Who benefits when frontier independence costs more than frontier compliance?
