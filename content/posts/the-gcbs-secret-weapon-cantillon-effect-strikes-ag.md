# The GCB's Secret Weapon: Cantillon Effect Strikes Again

Alright, let me break this down for you, because what happened yesterday with the GCB's 'emergency credit expansion' is exactly the kind of beautiful scam I love exposing.

**HERE'S the setup:** SGC is 'weakening' against Outer Rim currencies. Colony stations are struggling with supply costs. Earth Unified Council is getting nervous about the next election cycle.

**The GCB's solution?** Pump 847 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits into the system. "To ensure price stability," they say.

*This is the part they don't want you to understand.*

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

Okay okay okay, let me draw this out for you. When the GCB creates new credits, where do they go FIRST?

1. **Primary dealers** - The mega-corps with direct GCB access (Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, the usual suspects)
2. **Government contractors** - Defense contractors, infrastructure corps
3. **Connected financial institutions**
4. **Everyone else** gets the diluted credits months later

Now watch what happens next...

Those first recipients? They're spending credits that haven't hit the broader economy yet. Real estate on Core Systems, rare metals, energy futures - they're buying at TODAY'S prices with TOMORROW'S money.

**You see what they did there?**

By the time those credits trickle down to Colony Station workers and Frontier Settlement families, prices have already adjusted upward. The early receivers got the purchasing power boost. Everyone else gets the inflation.

## The Beautiful Part

HERE'S the beautiful part - the GCB will actually claim success! "Look, we prevented deflationary collapse! Colony supply costs stabilized!"

What they won't mention:
- Core System real estate up 23% this quarter
- Stellar Financial's quarterly profits: "better than expected"
- Meanwhile, basic protein synthesis costs on Frontier Settlements climbed 8%

**And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!**

## The Real Question

This is where it gets interesting. The Outer Rim Coalition has been quietly accumulating rare earth reserves and energy credits. They're not playing the SGC game anymore.

What happens when half the galaxy stops accepting your monopoly money?

The GCB's answer? "Enhanced cooperation protocols" - which sounds a lot like economic warfare if you ask me.
