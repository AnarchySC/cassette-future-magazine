# The Galactic Central Bank's Hidden Tax
## 信用拡張がどのようにあなたのポケットを空にするか

Alright, let me break this down because the Galactic Central Bank just pulled their favorite magic trick again.

Yesterday's announcement: "Emergency credit expansion of 2.4 trillion Standard Galactic Credits to ensure market stability." Sounds responsible, right? Wrong. This is the oldest con in the galaxy, and I'm about to show you exactly how it works.

## HERE'S the beautiful part—

When the GCB creates new credits out of thin air, who gets them first? Not you. Not your neighbor running that noodle stand on Station 7. The new money goes straight to:

- Stellar Financial (who got 340 billion SGC)
- Orion Trust (280 billion SGC) 
- Ceres Exchange primary dealers (the rest)

These institutions get to spend brand-new credits at today's prices. They buy assets, invest in mega-projects, expand their operations.

Now watch what happens next...

By the time those credits filter through the economy and reach your paycheck? Prices have already started climbing. The grocery synthesizer costs more. Transport fees jump. Your rent goes up.

You see what they did there? The first recipients got the purchasing power BEFORE inflation hit. Everyone else pays higher prices WITH the same income.

## This is the part they don't want you to understand

This isn't some mysterious economic force. It's a direct wealth transfer from savers to borrowers, from workers to asset holders, from the outer colonies to the Core Systems.

Here's the whiteboard moment: Imagine 100 people on a space station with 100 credits total. Everyone has 1 credit. Now the station administrator creates 50 new credits and gives them all to his buddy. 

Does the station suddenly have 50% more stuff to buy? No. Same resources, more credits chasing them. Prices rise 50%. 

The administrator's friend can still afford everything at the old prices. Everyone else? Their 1 credit now buys what 0.67 credits used to buy.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!

## The 2935 Twist

What makes this era special? The GCB can now target specific sectors instantly through neural-net coordination. Need to bail out failing Mars terraforming projects? Credit expansion targeted at "infrastructure development." Want to prop up Outer Rim mining? "Emergency liquidity for resource security."

Same scam, surgical precision.

## The Real Numbers

Since 2930, the GCB has expanded the credit supply by 847%. Your wages? Up 23%. 

Mega-corp asset values? Up 1,200%.

Coincidence? In my seventeen years covering this beat, I've learned there are no coincidences in monetary policy.

Every credit expansion is a tax on your purchasing power, paid directly to whoever gets the new money first. The beautiful part? They don't even have to pass a law.

Just remember: When they say "stimulus," ask yourself who's really getting stimulated.
