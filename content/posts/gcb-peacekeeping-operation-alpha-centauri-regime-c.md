*GCB 'Peacekeeping Operation': Alpha Centauri Regime Change*

経済制裁が失敗した後、軍事介入が開始

The Galactic Central Bank's "humanitarian intervention" on Alpha Centauri ended yesterday with the installation of Administrator Chen Wei-Lin, former GCB deputy director. The previous administration—elected six months ago on a platform of credit independence—was dissolved "for the colony's own protection."

GCB Chairman Morrison called the operation "a measured response to financial terrorism." The terrorism? Alpha Centauri's refusal to adopt the new Standard Galactic Credit protocols that would have transferred 40% of their resource extraction revenues to Earth.

I obtained leaked TIB briefings from before the deployment. Quote: "Economic measures insufficient. Recommend transition to kinetic solutions." That's bureaucrat-speak for "bombing didn't work, time for invasion."

The same briefings reveal Administrator Chen was selected for installation three weeks before the first "diplomatic outreach." They planned regime change before they even pretended to negotiate.

Chairman Morrison's press conference was a masterclass in doublespeak. "We respect Alpha Centauri's sovereignty," he declared while Fleet Admiral Park stood beside banners reading "LIBERATED TERRITORY."

When I asked Morrison to square those statements, he replied, "Context matters, Reina-san."

That's not an answer. Try again.

"The situation was complex—"

You said the opposite in your 2931 colony sovereignty speech. Which version is lying?

The Chairman ended the briefing early. Again.

Administrator Chen's first act was signing Executive Order AC-001, implementing the exact credit protocols the elected government rejected. "The people of Alpha Centauri deserve economic stability," Chen announced from her GCB-funded inauguration.

The "people of Alpha Centauri" weren't consulted. Their representatives are in detention facilities pending "democratic transition training."

Former Prime Minister Nakamura, speaking from an undisclosed location, put it simply: "They came for our credits. Everything else is theater."

The Earth Network News coverage focused on "grateful colonists celebrating liberation." The celebrating colonists were GCB contractors. I verified the employment records.

Fleet personnel are already moving to secure the lithium mines—excuse me, "protect critical infrastructure." The same infrastructure Alpha Centauri wanted to manage independently.

Don't tell me this was about democracy. Tell me why the first "liberated" facilities were resource extraction sites.

The Solar Defense Compact rubber-stamped the operation with their usual efficiency. "Regional stability requires difficult decisions," declared Secretary-General Okafor.

Translation: We're keeping the credits flowing.

Next week's GCB quarterly report will show a convenient uptick in resource revenues from "stabilized regions." Pure coincidence, naturally.

The pattern holds: Economic pressure, manufactured crisis, military intervention, compliant administration, resource extraction. They used the same playbook on Europa, Titan, and now Alpha Centauri.

Contradictions don't exist. Check your premises.

The premise that this was about peace collapsed the moment they installed a banker as administrator. The premise that this was about democracy collapsed when they detained the elected government.

What remains is what it always was: Credits and control.

Chairman Morrison will hold another briefing Thursday. I'll be there with the employment records.
