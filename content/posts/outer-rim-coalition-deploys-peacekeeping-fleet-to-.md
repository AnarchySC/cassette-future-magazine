# Another Totally Normal Day in Galactic Diplomacy

The Earth Unified Council held an emergency session yesterday to discuss what they're calling a "routine diplomatic exchange" with the Outer Rim Coalition. You know, the kind where 847 armed battlecruisers suddenly appear in your backyard.

"This is absolutely not an invasion," insisted Defense Secretary Morrison, sweat visible through his ceremonial bio-suit. "It's a... wellness check. They're concerned about our planetary health."

I just think it's funny that the Coalition's "wellness check" includes plasma torpedo arrays pointed directly at Luna Station's main reactor.

The Coalition's Admiral Chen—no relation, different Chen entirely—issued a statement from her flagship *Inevitable Conclusion*: "We noticed unusual energy signatures from the Core Systems and wanted to ensure our neighbors weren't experiencing any... difficulties."

Wait, it gets better.

Those "unusual energy signatures" she mentioned? Turns out they're from the massive military buildup Earth's been conducting for the past six months. You remember—the one they kept calling "infrastructure improvements" and "defensive modernization."

Secretary Morrison's office released 847 pages of documentation proving these weren't weapons platforms. Oddly, the Coalition brought exactly 847 ships. I'm not saying someone's been reading each other's classified mail, but I'm just reading their fleet counts aloud.

The Interstellar Assembly called an emergency session, which lasted exactly twelve minutes. Representative Park from the Titan Colonies summarized their position: "Everyone please stop pointing continent-destroying weapons at each other. It's making the trade routes nervous."

Earth Network News is running wall-to-wall coverage titled "Diplomatic Breakthrough in Core Systems," featuring expert panels discussing the "unprecedented cooperation" between former rivals. Meanwhile, civilian evacuation shuttles have been quietly launching from orbital platforms for three days straight. 

Commodity markets are responding with their usual calm. Standard Galactic Credits are fluctuating wildly, Terran Defense Bonds are somehow hitting record highs, and someone's been buying massive futures contracts on asteroid mining equipment.

The funniest part? Both sides keep insisting this is all perfectly routine. The Coalition fleet is just "passing through" on their way to... somewhere else. Earth's newly activated defense grid is experiencing "routine maintenance cycles" that happen to make everything glow ominously.

And nobody laughed?

Both councils have scheduled a joint press conference for tomorrow. According to the preliminary agenda, they plan to discuss "mutual cooperation frameworks" and "shared security interests."

Translation: They're going to smile at each other while 847 weapons platforms hover overhead, and pretend this is how neighbors normally say hello.

Anyway.
