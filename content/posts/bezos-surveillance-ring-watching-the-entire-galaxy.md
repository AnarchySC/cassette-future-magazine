# The Ring Closes Tighter

So the Ceres Post is bleeding credits faster than a hull breach, the Environmental Protection Bureau just decided carbon dioxide isn't actually dangerous anymore (shocking absolutely no one who's read their funding reports), and Orbital Security's Ring network can now track your pet cyber-cat through seventeen different habitat modules.

I just think it's funny—

Wait, let me get this timeline straight. Jeff Bezos III launches the Ceres Post as the "galaxy's most trusted news source," promising editorial independence. Then his logistics empire, Orbital Security, starts selling "safety devices" that happen to record everything within scanning range. The Post runs glowing reviews of Ring products. Orbital Security shares "anonymized" data with the Terran Intelligence Bureau.

And nobody laughed?

The Environmental Protection Bureau's sudden reversal on atmospheric carbon is *chef's kiss* perfect timing. Right after Titan Industries donated 50 million SGC to "climate research," suddenly their methane processing plants aren't environmental hazards anymore. They're "atmospheric recycling facilities." 

The EPB director announced this with a straight face while standing next to a Titan Industries logo that was literally smoking.

But here's where it gets *really* good. Ring surveillance isn't just tracking criminals anymore. Your grandmother's medication dispenser? Connected to Ring. Reports dosage "irregularities" to health authorities. Your pet's bio-chip? Ring-compatible. Flags "suspicious movement patterns." Your teenager's study pod? Ring-integrated. Monitors for "educational compliance."

Orbital Security calls this "comprehensive habitat safety."

I call it Tuesday.

The Ceres Post, meanwhile, runs puff pieces about how Ring makes families "closer together." Which is technically true—it's hard to have privacy-based distance when every device in your module is broadcasting to corporate databases.

They said surveillance. Then they said safety. Then they said convenience. Now they're not saying anything because the Post's investigative budget got redirected to "lifestyle content."

I'm not saying it's a grift. I'm just reading their privacy policy aloud. All forty-seven pages of legal text that essentially boil down to: "We record everything, share with everyone, and you clicked 'agree' so shut up."

The best part? Ring's user agreement includes a clause about "predictive security measures." They don't just watch what you do—they analyze what you *might* do. Your browsing patterns suggest anti-corporate sentiment? Ring alerts local security. Your purchasing history indicates "resource hoarding"? Ring flags you for economic monitoring.

It's minority report meets corporate quarterly earnings.

Bezos III tweeted yesterday: "Privacy advocates don't understand modern safety needs." This from a man whose personal estate has a twelve-kilometer no-fly zone and signal jammers that would make the military jealous.

But sure, grandma's pill dispenser needs real-time government monitoring.

Anyway.

The Interstellar Assembly is holding hearings next month about Ring's data practices. Betting pools have already opened on how many committee members will suddenly develop "scheduling conflicts" after their campaign fund reports come out.

Wait, it gets better—Ring just announced they're launching Ring Solar, Ring Agricultural, and Ring Educational. Because apparently we haven't surveilled enough of daily life yet.

They said it was about doorbell security.

I'll wait.
