# How Small Clinics Solve Big Problems

Dr. Elena Vasquez poured tea while she explained how eighteen families on Kepler-442b accidentally revolutionized frontier medicine.

"We just got tired of waiting," she said, watching her six-year-old daughter sort medical supplies by color. "The corporate clinic charged 400 SGC for a broken arm. We had three kids and a mining accident every month. Do the math."

So they figured it out together. Nobody told them to.

The Kepler Medical Collective started in Vasquez's kitchen three years ago. Eighteen families pooled resources—one medic, two retired nurses, a fabrication engineer who could print surgical tools, a teacher who handled record-keeping. Everyone contributed what they had.

I asked who's in charge. They looked at me strangely.

"Whoever's here when someone needs help," said Marcus Chen, the fab engineer. "Elena handles surgeries. I fix equipment. Mrs. Rodriguez manages supplies because she's scary good at math. It's not complicated."

Their outcomes aren't just good—they're embarrassing the corporate stations. Zero surgical infections this year. Maternal mortality: zero. Treatment delays: practically nonexistent. Cost per patient: 60% less than Stellar Health Corp's nearest facility.

Stellar's regional director, David Kruger, calls it "unsustainable without proper oversight and profit incentives." His station serves twelve colonies with a staff of 200 and quarterly earnings reports that satisfy shareholders on three worlds.

The collective serves one settlement with whoever shows up.

"Last month, little Yuki Tanaka fell down a mine shaft," Vasquez said. "Compound fracture, possible internal bleeding. In the corporate system, we'd fill out forms, wait for authorization, transfer her to the trauma center on Proxima Station—maybe six hours if we're lucky."

Instead, Chen fabricated surgical plates while Rodriguez prepped the operating space they'd built in the community center. Vasquez had Yuki stabilized in forty minutes.

"She was playing soccer two weeks later," Rodriguez added, showing me the scar that's already fading.

Back home, we'd just call this Tuesday. But here in the frontier settlements, it's apparently revolutionary.

The collective shares everything—equipment, knowledge, costs, decisions. When they needed an MRI scanner, they crowdfunded it across six settlements. When the pharmacorp tried to triple medication prices, they started growing their own antibiotics in Chen's basement lab.

"The weird part isn't that it works," said Dr. Sarah Kim, who left Stellar Health to join them. "The weird part is how surprised everyone acts that neighbors helping neighbors could possibly function better than a bureaucracy designed to extract profit from suffering."

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other.

Stellar Health Corp is now studying the collective's "innovative care delivery model" to see what can be "scaled and monetized across corporate healthcare networks."

The collective members just laughed when I told them.
