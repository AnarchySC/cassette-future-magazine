# The Quantum Memory Wars Heat Up

The Outer Rim Coalition just announced their third major quantum memory fabrication facility this cycle. While Earth Network News calls it "healthy competition," the numbers tell a different story.

I've been tracking memory production across the galaxy for the past solar year. The Coalition now controls 47% of all quantum-crystalline DRAM manufacturing. That's up from 12% just five cycles ago.

Here's what makes this interesting: they're not just building faster chips. They're vertical-integrating everything from raw synthesis to final assembly. When one entity controls that much of the production chain, small colony settlements get squeezed out.

## The Real Cost

Frontier settlements are reporting 340% price increases for basic memory modules. These aren't luxury components - we're talking about the storage needed for life support systems, agricultural processors, atmospheric recyclers.

I replicated their basic quantum-crystalline synthesis process in my public lab last month. The raw materials cost maybe 2 Standard Galactic Credits per terabyte. Current retail? 847 SGC.

They patented *crystalline lattice arrangements*. Think about that. They're claiming ownership of how atoms organize themselves.

## What You Can Do

The Coalition's patents expire in 2947. But twelve cycles is a long time when your settlement's memory banks are failing.

I'm open-sourcing the synthesis protocols I developed. Yes, the yield rates are lower than industrial processes. Yes, you'll need a basic molecular fabricator. But it works, and you can build it yourself.

The interesting part isn't that small-scale synthesis is possible - it's that the Coalition spent billions developing "revolutionary" techniques that are basically scaled-up versions of what any competent chemist could build in their garage.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't really about memory chips. It's about dependency. When three mega-corps control 73% of galactic memory production, every colony becomes a customer rather than a participant.

The Outer Rim Coalition talks about "bringing advanced technology to frontier markets." But they're simultaneously making it illegal for those markets to develop their own alternatives.

I tested their latest quantum-DRAM against open-source alternatives. Performance difference? Negligible for most applications. Price difference? 2,300%.

## Building Our Own

Next month, I'm hosting fabrication workshops at the public lab. We'll build working memory modules from scratch using Coalition-free synthesis methods. Bring a molecular printer and patience.

The goal isn't to compete with industrial production. It's to prove that essential technology doesn't have to be someone else's monopoly.

Here's how you can try this yourself: Start with basic silicon-carbide substrates. The quantum crystallization process requires precise temperature control, but nothing you can't achieve with standard lab equipment...

Remember: they want you to think this technology is impossibly complex. It's not. It's just artificially scarce.
