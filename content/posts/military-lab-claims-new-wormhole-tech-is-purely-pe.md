# The Terran Defense Research Institute made history yesterday

Not for their breakthrough in stable wormhole generation—though that's impressive. No, they made history by saying with a straight face that technology capable of instantly transporting fleets across the galaxy has "purely civilian applications."

I just think it's funny—

Dr. Sarah Yamamoto, lead researcher, stood before reporters and explained how their new Quantum Tunnel Stabilizer could "revolutionize cargo transport and scientific exploration." She did not mention why the prototype is mounted on a Dreadnought-class battleship. Or why the research grant came from the Solar Defense Compact's "Rapid Strike Capability" fund.

"This technology will bring the colonies closer together," she insisted, as three Fleet Admirals nodded approvingly in the background.

Wait, it gets better.

The press release specifically states the wormholes are "too small for military vessels." The demonstration video shows a destroyer emerging from one. When I pointed this out, Dr. Yamamoto clarified that destroyers don't count as "military vessels" in the "technical sense" because they're "multipurpose platforms."

Anyway.

The Solar Defense Compact immediately announced plans to install these "civilian cargo accelerators" at key strategic points throughout the galaxy. Pure coincidence that these locations happen to be chokepoints controlling access to Outer Rim Coalition space.

Fleet Admiral Chen assured reporters that rapid deployment of peacekeeping forces to any corner of the galaxy within minutes would "stabilize interstellar commerce." He said this while standing next to a holographic display labeled "TARGET ACQUISITION SCENARIOS."

I asked Dr. Yamamoto if she found it curious that her "peaceful exploration technology" required a weapons lock to function properly. She replied that was a "safety feature" to prevent "unauthorized commercial use."

They said this. Then they classified the blueprints under the Galactic Security Act. I'll wait.

The Outer Rim Coalition issued a statement calling the technology "deeply concerning for regional stability." The Earth Unified Council responded by activating three more "research installations" along the Rim border, each equipped with these purely peaceful wormhole generators.

Commander Rodriguez explained to concerned colony representatives that the installations are "purely defensive" and "definitely not staging areas for rapid invasion capabilities." He said this next to a sign reading "OPERATION DISTANT THUNDER FORWARD BASE GAMMA."

And nobody laughed?

I'm not saying it's a grift. I'm just reading their budget aloud: "Project Peaceful Pathways: 847 billion SGC for civilian wormhole research. Project specifications: Military-grade targeting systems, fleet-capable aperture diameter, combat deployment protocols."

Meanwhile, actual civilian transport companies are still using century-old fusion drives because the "peaceful" technology remains classified at Cosmic Secret level.

But hey—at least we'll have peace. The kind that comes from overwhelming tactical superiority deployable anywhere in the galaxy within thirty seconds.

Dr. Yamamoto concluded yesterday's presentation by thanking the Solar Defense Compact for their "generous support of pure scientific inquiry." Behind her, a hologram showed projected fleet movements labeled "LIBERATION SCENARIOS - PHASE ONE."

I just think it's funny.
