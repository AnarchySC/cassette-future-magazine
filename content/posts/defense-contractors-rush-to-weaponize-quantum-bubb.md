# Scientists Find Thing. Military Wants to Shoot It.

Researchers at the Titan Deep Space Observatory announced yesterday they've detected what they're calling "quantum foam bubbles" - microscopic tears in spacetime that could theoretically allow near-instantaneous travel between star systems.

The discovery lasted exactly 6.3 hours in civilian hands.

By this morning, the Terran Intelligence Bureau had classified the entire research team, the Solar Defense Compact had issued 47 new procurement contracts, and three mega-corps were already advertising "quantum superiority solutions" to colony defense ministries.

"We thought we'd found a way to make interstellar commerce actually profitable," said Dr. Sarah Chen-Nakamura, now speaking from an undisclosed location. "Turns out we found a way to make warfare even more expensive."

Wait, it gets better.

Stellar Dynamics Corporation - which somehow filed patents on quantum foam weaponization *before* the discovery was announced - received 847 billion SGC to develop "defensive quantum disruption systems." Their stock jumped 340% in pre-market trading.

Their CEO, Admiral Marcus Sterling (retired), told investors: "We must ensure these quantum capabilities don't fall into the wrong hands. Specifically, any hands that aren't ours."

I asked Sterling how his company filed patents on technology that was discovered yesterday.

"Prescient R&D investment," he said, not blinking.

I asked if that meant they knew about quantum foam bubbles before the scientists did.

"Next question."

Meanwhile, the Outer Rim Coalition announced they're developing their own quantum foam program "for purely defensive purposes." They've allocated 1.2 trillion SGC and classified it so thoroughly that even their finance minister doesn't know what they're funding.

And the scientists? Dr. Chen-Nakamura's team wanted to study whether quantum foam could solve the interstellar shipping crisis. You know, the one causing food shortages on seventeen frontier worlds.

Instead, they're now designing ways to collapse enemy quantum bubbles "before they can be weaponized against us."

"It's like discovering fire and immediately being asked to build better ways to burn down your neighbor's house," Chen-Nakamura said.

I just think it's funny - we found a way to instantly transport grain shipments to starving colonies, and within hours it became a 2-trillion-SGC arms race.

Anyway, Stellar Dynamics is hiring. They're looking for "quantum warfare specialists" with "experience in defensive foam applications."

The job posting was published yesterday. The discovery was announced yesterday.

And nobody laughed?
