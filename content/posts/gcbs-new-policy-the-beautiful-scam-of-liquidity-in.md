# The GCB Just Pulled Their Favorite Magic Trick Again

Okay okay okay, let me break this down for you. The Galactic Central Bank announced yesterday they're injecting 2.4 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits into the system. Emergency measures, they say. Critical economic support.

But here's the whiteboard moment - let me draw out exactly what happens when they flip that digital printing switch.

## Step One: The Money Appears

The GCB creates 2.4 trillion SGC with literally keystrokes. No mining asteroids for rare metals, no increased productivity across the colonies - just *poof*, new credits exist. They buy up Stellar Financial and Orion Trust bonds with this fresh currency.

## Step Two: Watch the Flow

Now HERE'S the beautiful part - those mega-corps get the new money first. Before prices adjust. Before anyone else even knows it exists. They're buying up real assets - station infrastructure, mining rights, productive capacity - with currency that hasn't been diluted yet.

Meanwhile, what are you holding? The old credits. The ones about to lose purchasing power.

## Step Three: The Ripple Effect

By the time this "liquidity" trickles down to frontier settlements and colony workers, prices have already adjusted. That hab-unit you were saving for? Just got 15% more expensive. Your wages? Still the same number of credits, but now each one buys less.

You see what they did there? They transferred wealth from every credit-holder to whoever got the new money first. And that's NEVER the working colonists.

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

This is the part they don't want you to understand. French economist Richard Cantillon figured this out back in the 18th century - proximity to the money printer determines who benefits from inflation. The GCB just executed a textbook wealth transfer, and they called it "economic stimulus."

The mega-corps closest to the GCB's digital spigot get to spend new credits at yesterday's prices. Everyone else? You get to pay tomorrow's prices with yesterday's wages.

## The Beautiful Irony

Here's my favorite part - they're calling this "fighting deflation" and "maintaining price stability." But stable for whom? Certainly not for the asteroid miners watching their savings evaporate while Orion Trust executives buy up another mining consortium with freshly minted credits.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! The most elegant wealth redistribution scheme ever devised, wrapped in the language of monetary policy.

Now watch what happens next - they'll blame "supply chain disruptions" and "colonial wage pressures" for the price increases. Never the 2.4 trillion credits they just conjured into existence.

This is why sound money matters. This is why decentralized currencies scare them. Because once you understand how the game works, you stop playing by their rules.
