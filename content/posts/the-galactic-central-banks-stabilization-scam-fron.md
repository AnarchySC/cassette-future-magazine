# The Same Old Song, Different Millennium

Alright, let me break this down because the Galactic Central Bank just pulled their favorite trick again, and I'm watching colonists across the Outer Rim scratching their heads wondering why their fabrication credits suddenly buy less.

The GCB announced yesterday they're injecting 847 trillion Standard Galactic Credits into the system to "maintain interstellar commerce stability." Beautiful language, right? Makes it sound like they're fixing something.

HERE'S the beautiful part—they're not fixing anything. They're redistributing wealth, and you're not getting any.

## The Cantillon Effect Goes Galactic

Okay okay okay, let me draw this out for you. When the GCB creates new credits out of thin air (which is literally what they do—quantum ledger entries, nothing more), where do those credits go first?

To the mega-corps. Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, the big mining consortiums on Ceres. They get to spend these fresh credits at yesterday's prices.

Now watch what happens next...

Those credits flow through the system like ripples in a pond. The mega-corps buy up resources, equipment, whole asteroid fields. Prices start rising. By the time these credits reach your frontier settlement? You're paying tomorrow's inflated prices with yesterday's wages.

You see what they did there? The first receivers got richer, the last receivers got poorer, and everybody in between thinks it's just "market forces."

## The Core Systems Casino

This is the part they don't want you to understand: credit expansion isn't economic policy—it's a wealth transfer mechanism. From the frontier to the core. From colonists to corporations. From your fabrication shop to their quarterly profits.

Last cycle's "emergency stabilization"? Ceres Exchange hit record highs while colony settlements saw their highest credit dilution in decades. Coincidence? 

I've got the data. When the GCB expands credit supply by 12%, Core Systems assets appreciate by 15-20%. Frontier settlements see purchasing power drop by 8-10%. Every. Single. Time.

## The Beautiful Scam

Here's the whiteboard moment: they call it "maintaining liquidity" but what they're really doing is maintaining the gap between rich and poor. Between core and rim. Between those who get the credits first and those who get them last.

The colonist working double shifts in the lithium mines? His credits are worth less every cycle. The Stellar Financial executive who got the fresh credits? He just bought three more mining operations at pre-inflation prices.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! Named after some ancient Earth economist who figured out that money printing benefits the politically connected at the expense of everyone else.

## Breaking the Chain

So what's a frontier colony to do? 

First, understand the game. When you hear "credit expansion" or "monetary stimulus," translate that to "wealth redistribution upward."

Second, build local resilience. Barter networks, resource sharing, anything that reduces dependence on SGC transactions.

Third, demand better. Every colony administration should be asking why their citizens subsidize Core Systems prosperity through systematic credit dilution.

The GCB wants you to think this is all too complex to understand. It's not. It's a heist, and they've been running it for centuries.

Time to stop playing along.
