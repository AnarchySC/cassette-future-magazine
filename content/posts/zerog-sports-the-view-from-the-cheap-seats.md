# Zero-G Sports: The View from the Cheap Seats

*なぜ地球の子供たちが宇宙で勝てないのか*

The Interstellar Athletic Commission announced record viewership for this cycle's zero-G racing finals - 2.3 billion neural-feed connections across seventeen systems. Earth sponsors paid premium rates for advertising slots. The winners? Same as always: kids who grew up hauling cargo between asteroids.

That's one version of events. Here's another: Earth's Unified Sports Ministry spent 847 million SGC last fiscal year on "development programs" for zero-G athletics. Training facilities on Luna, Mars, and three orbital stations. Professional coaching staff. Nutritional supplements shipped at considerable expense. The goal, according to ministry broadcasts, was "ensuring fair competition for Earth-born athletes."

Result: Earth teams finished seventh, ninth, and fifteenth in this year's championship brackets.

Meanwhile, Ceres Mining Collective fielded a team trained in converted cargo bays during off-shift hours. Equipment budget: whatever they could fabricate from scrap titanium. Coaching staff: whoever wasn't pulling double shifts that week. They swept the propulsion racing categories.

"Natural advantage," explained Dr. Sarah Chen-Nakamura, Earth Sports Institute. "Frontier children develop superior spatial awareness and muscle memory for three-dimensional movement."

Free, they said. I checked the fine print.

The "amateur" classification for zero-G sports requires athletes to maintain non-professional status. Definition: cannot receive more than 50,000 SGC annually in direct compensation. Doesn't cover housing allowances, meal credits, equipment provisions, or "educational scholarships."

Earth athletes receive comprehensive support packages valued at 180,000 SGC per year. Technically amateur. Frontier kids get what they've always gotten: whatever they can earn between shifts.

The Interstellar Athletic Commission, headquartered in Geneva Station, sets competition standards. Current regulations specify equipment tolerances, arena dimensions, and safety protocols. All designed around Earth manufacturing specifications. Coincidentally, this makes Earth-produced gear mandatory for official competition.

A basic racing suit costs 47,000 SGC retail. Shipping to outer rim settlements adds another 12,000 SGC. Most frontier teams pool resources to buy one suit per team, shared during qualifying rounds.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce "equipment standardization" across seventeen star systems.

This year's championship prize: 2.8 million SGC, distributed among winning teams. Broadcast revenue from Earth networks: 847 million SGC. Licensing fees paid to Earth-based Athletic Commission: 15% of all revenue.

Viewers pay premium rates for live neural-feed access. Earth citizens: 200 SGC per event. Frontier settlements: 850 SGC per event, "due to transmission infrastructure costs."

The kids who win these competitions return to their cargo hauling jobs. The Earth teams that finish last return to their training facilities and increased funding allocations.

Who exactly benefits from this "development of interstellar athletics?"

*Next week: Examining why Mars terraforming projects consistently run 300% over budget while atmospheric processors built by frontier engineers cost one-tenth the price.*

Why does expertise always seem to flow uphill toward Earth, while funding flows down to where the real work gets done?
