# Who's Responsible When You Catch a Cold in Space?

Mariko poured tea while she explained how they handle medical emergencies on Kepler Station. "We don't wait for permits," she said, checking the hydroponic mint growing on her kitchen counter. "Someone gets hurt, we fix them. Someone gets sick, we figure it out."

I'd come to Kepler expecting to write about their notorious reputation for ignoring Galactic Health Authority protocols. What I found instead were 30,000 people who've quietly built something that works better than what replaced it.

Kepler Station orbits a mining asteroid three months from the nearest GHA clinic. When the Authority restructured healthcare delivery in 2931, promising "efficient centralized care," residents here discovered that efficiency means watching people die while waiting for approval codes.

"My daughter broke her arm during a gravity fluctuation," explains Chen Wei, pointing to eight-year-old Ling playing in the station's common area. "Standard procedure requires filing incident reports, medical authorization requests, insurance verification. Takes six hours minimum. Bones don't wait for bureaucracy."

Instead, they figured it out together. Nobody told them to.

Dr. Sarah Kim, formerly a GHA-certified physician, now runs what residents simply call "the clinic." It's not registered with any authority. It doesn't bill the Galactic Central Bank. It doesn't exist in official records.

"I treat whoever needs treatment," she said while reorganizing her supply cabinet. "We grow our own antibiotics, print our own medical devices, train each other in emergency procedures. The GHA wants to license my stethoscope. Back home, we'd just build another one."

The numbers tell a story authorities don't want to hear. Kepler Station reports lower infection rates, faster trauma response times, and zero medical bankruptcies. Emergency procedures that take six hours through official channels happen in minutes here.

I asked who's in charge of medical decisions. They looked at me strangely.

"Charge of what?" laughed maintenance engineer Yuki Tanaka, whose side job involves manufacturing surgical tools. "If someone needs help, we help. If we don't know how, we learn. If we need supplies, we make them or trade for them. Why would we need someone in charge of that?"

The GHA recently announced new "compliance enforcement measures" for unauthorized medical facilities. Residents seem unconcerned. They've been building redundant systems, training more people, establishing mutual aid networks with other independent settlements.

"They can shut down our clinic," Dr. Kim noted, watching children play in the garden where pharmaceutical plants grow alongside vegetables. "They can't shut down what we know. They can't un-teach us how to take care of each other."

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other with their lives—and when people realize they don't need permission to heal.
