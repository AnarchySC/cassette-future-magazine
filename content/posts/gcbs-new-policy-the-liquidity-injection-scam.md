# The Great Credit Heist of 2935

Alright, let me break this down for you because what the GCB announced yesterday isn't monetary policy—it's highway robbery with a fancy name.

## Here's What They're Telling You

The Galactic Central Bank dropped 2.4 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits into the Ceres Exchange yesterday. *"Emergency liquidity support for critical infrastructure development,"* they said. *"Ensuring interstellar trade stability,"* they promised.

Sounds responsible, right? Wrong.

## Now Watch What Actually Happens

HERE'S the beautiful part—and by beautiful, I mean absolutely criminal:

**Step 1:** GCB creates 2.4 trillion SGCs out of thin air. Literally. Digital entries. No mining asteroids, no increased productivity, just *poof*—money exists.

**Step 2:** This fresh credit goes FIRST to Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, and the other mega-corps. They get to spend these credits at TODAY'S prices.

**Step 3:** By the time this credit dilution reaches the Outer Rim colonies—your grocery stations, your fuel depots, your housing pods—prices have already adjusted upward.

You see what they did there? The mega-corps got real goods at old prices. You get higher prices with the same paycheck.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!

## The Real Numbers

Let me draw this out for you:

- **Core Systems inflation:** 2.1% (barely noticeable)
- **Mid-Rim inflation:** 8.4% (getting spicy)
- **Outer Rim colonies:** 23.7% (absolute devastation)

This isn't coincidence. This is the system working EXACTLY as designed.

## The Part They Don't Want You to Understand

Every credit dilution event transfers wealth from the edges to the center. From workers to owners of assets. From colonies to core systems.

The Frontier Settlements are funding Earth's mega-corp bailouts through purchasing power theft. A colonist's lunch ration that cost 15 SGCs last month? Now it's 18 SGCs. Same ration, same nutrition, but the GCB just made it 20% harder for frontier families to eat.

Meanwhile, Stellar Financial's board just bought three more asteroid mining operations at pre-inflation prices.

## This is the Part Where You Get Mad

The GCB claims this supports "interstellar trade stability." But whose trade? Whose stability?

The system is rigged, and they're not even hiding it anymore. They just bet most people won't connect the dots between "emergency liquidity" announcements and why their rent payment keeps getting harder to make.

Well, now you know. Every time you hear "liquidity injection," translate it to "wealth transfer from you to them."

**The house always wins. The question is: are you the house, or are you the game?**
