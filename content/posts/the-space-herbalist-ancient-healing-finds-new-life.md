Dr. Elena Vasquez poured tea while she explained how everything started. "The company medic left three years ago," she said, gesturing toward the thriving walls of green that fill what used to be Storage Bay C. "Corporate said they'd send a replacement. Still waiting."

Hygeia-7 sits deep in the asteroid belt, a mining station home to 847 people who extract rare minerals for the Core Systems. When Stellar MedCorp pulled their on-site physician, they left behind a handful of emergency stims and a promise to "reassess staffing needs pending quarterly projections."

The miners figured it out together. Nobody told them to.

Vasquez, who studied ethnobotany before the company recruited her as a hydroponics specialist, started small. A colleague mentioned chronic pain from the heavy machinery. She remembered her grandmother's remedies—willow bark for inflammation, chamomile for sleep, echinacea for immunity.

"I asked who's in charge of approving treatments," she laughed. "They looked at me strangely. 'Elena,' they said, 'we're 400 million kilometers from the nearest health inspector.'"

Three years later, her garden produces medicine for everything from respiratory infections to anxiety disorders. The station's neural-net connects her with traditional healers across the Outer Rim Coalition, sharing knowledge that Terran medical academies dismissed centuries ago.

I spent two weeks watching how it actually works. Miner Jin Nakamura stops by for ginger root—his wife's morning sickness from their second pregnancy. Environmental tech Maria Santos picks up valerian for insomnia caused by rotating shifts. Children come for immune boosters during cold season, their parents paying in extra ration credits or repair favors.

"Back home, we'd just go to the community health coordinator," I mentioned. Vasquez nodded. "That's what this is. Just without the paperwork."

The station reports lower sick days, fewer mental health crises, and what supervisor Chen Wu calls "better morale overall." Corporate occasionally asks about medical expenses. "We tell them we're very healthy out here," Wu smiled.

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other. No medical degrees hanging on walls, no insurance networks or prescription databases. Just a former botanist who remembered that healing belonged to communities long before it belonged to corporations.

Vasquez showed me her newest project—training three other residents in herbal preparation. "When I retire, this needs to continue," she said. "The company will never send that medic. But we don't need them to."

She paused, checking on a tray of seedlings. "Funny how far you have to go from civilization to remember how to take care of each other."
