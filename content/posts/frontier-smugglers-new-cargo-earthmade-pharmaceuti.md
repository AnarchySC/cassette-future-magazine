# Frontier Smugglers' New Cargo: Earth-Made Pharmaceuticals

*辺境密輸業者の新しい商品：地球製薬品*

The shipping manifests tell one story. The actual cargo tells another.

Last week's raid on *Hermes Dawn*, a registered grain hauler, yielded 47 tons of wheat and 3.2 tons of unmarked medical supplies. Street value on Kepler Station: 890,000 Standard Galactic Credits. That's more than the ship's legitimate cargo earned in two years.

The contraband? Earth-manufactured insulin, antibiotics, and neural stabilizers. All legal. All desperately needed. All priced beyond frontier budgets by Earth Unified Council regulations.

"We're just balancing supply and demand," said the *Hermes Dawn*'s captain during interrogation. Colonial Security released her after 72 hours. No charges filed.

That's one version of events.

The numbers paint a clearer picture. Earth pharmaceutical giants report record profits - up 340% since the Unified Health Directive took effect three years ago. Meanwhile, colony medical centers ration treatments that were once routine. A month's insulin supply costs 2,100 SGC on Kepler Station. The same medication retails for 180 SGC in Earth's suburban districts.

"Free universal healthcare," the Earth Council promised the colonies. I checked the fine print. Free meant colonies pay through resource extraction quotas. Universal meant Earth corporations hold exclusive distribution rights.

Colonial administrators quietly admit the obvious: enforcement costs more than the smuggling. Each interdiction mission requires three patrol ships, orbital scanning arrays, and boarding teams. Total operational cost: 45,000 SGC per raid. Average contraband value seized: 12,000 SGC.

The math doesn't balance. It's not supposed to.

"The goal isn't profit," explains Terran Intelligence Bureau spokesman David Chen. "It's maintaining regulatory integrity across all systems."

Meanwhile, frontier mortality rates climb. Heart medication shortages on Europa Seven. Antibiotic rationing on Titan Base. Neural stabilizer black market prices hit 1,200 SGC per dose - a miner's monthly wage.

The smugglers adapt faster than the enforcers. Grain ships carry hidden compartments. Asteroid miners cache supplies in abandoned claims. Even Colonial Security officers look the other way when their own families need medication.

"We're creating criminals out of people trying to stay alive," admits one station commander, speaking off-record. "But policy comes from Earth. We just follow orders."

The manifest doesn't match the cargo. It never does when survival depends on looking elsewhere.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce regulations that colonies never agreed to follow?
