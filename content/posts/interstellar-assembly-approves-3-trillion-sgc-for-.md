# Another Tuesday, Another Trillion

The Interstellar Assembly today voted overwhelmingly to approve Emergency Resolution 2935-44, allocating 3.2 trillion Standard Galactic Credits for what Fleet Admiral Sarah Chen-Nakamura called "essential stability operations in the Outer Rim."

I just think it's funny—six months ago, these same officials were telling us the Outer Rim Coalition posed "minimal strategic concern." Today, apparently, they're an existential threat requiring immediate intervention. What changed? Well, the Coalition announced plans to establish their own rare earth mining operations on Kepler-442b. 

Wait, it gets better.

The emergency session was called after what Assembly Speaker Martinez described as "credible intelligence of destabilization activities." When I asked what specific activities, I was told the information was classified. When I asked how Assembly members voted on classified information they couldn't review, I got a very long explanation about "trusted briefing protocols."

Stellar Dynamics Corp saw its stock jump 34% in pre-session trading. Pure coincidence, I'm sure. They definitely didn't know their subsidiary, Harmony Defense Systems, would be the primary contractor for Operation Stellar Harmony. That would be insider trading, which is illegal.

The operation will deploy 200,000 fleet personnel across seventeen star systems to "maintain shipping lane security and protect civilian populations from extremist elements." 

Councilor Kim Wei-sung from the Titan delegation asked a reasonable question: "Which extremist elements?" The response was fascinating. Admiral Chen-Nakamura explained that Coalition mining operations could "potentially destabilize regional economics, leading to conditions where extremist elements might theoretically emerge."

So we're preventing theoretical extremists from maybe appearing if economic conditions hypothetically change. For 3.2 trillion credits.

Anyway.

The Outer Rim Coalition released a statement calling the operation "unprovoked aggression against sovereign territories." Earth Network News described this as "defiant rhetoric from destabilizing forces." They said this. Then they did this. I'll wait.

The funding breakdown is illuminating: 2.1 trillion for "fleet deployment and logistics," 800 billion for "infrastructure protection," and 300 billion for "humanitarian assistance." I asked Fleet Command what infrastructure we're protecting that we don't already control. Apparently, that's also classified.

Assembly Member Rodriguez-Park from the Luna Colony tried to propose an amendment requiring quarterly progress reports. It failed 734-136. Transparency is expensive when you're operating on a peacekeeping budget.

Operation Stellar Harmony begins next month. Stellar Dynamics has already opened three new fabrication facilities. The Coalition has recalled its ambassadors. And I have seventeen new defense ministry accounts blocking me on neural-feeds.

Nobody laughed during the vote. I thought that was the funniest part.
