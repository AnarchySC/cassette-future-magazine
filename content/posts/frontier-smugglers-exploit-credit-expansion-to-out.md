# Criminals Thank Galactic Central Bank For Easy Money

The Kepler-442b Colony Administration issued another plea this week for updated patrol ships. They won't get them. But the smugglers they're chasing? They just bought three new stealth freighters.

Welcome to credit expansion economics, frontier edition.

The Galactic Central Bank's decision to flood the system with cheap Standard Galactic Credits has produced an interesting side effect: criminals are better funded than cops. Smuggling syndicates can access the same artificially low interest rates as "legitimate" businesses. The difference is they actually use the money to expand operations.

"We submitted our fleet upgrade request eighteen months ago," Colony Administrator Chen Nakamura told me via neural-link from Kepler-442b. "We're still waiting for budget approval. Meanwhile, the Void Runners just acquired military-grade cloaking tech."

The Void Runners didn't respond to interview requests. They were probably busy not being detected.

Here's what the GCB doesn't want to discuss: cheap credit doesn't distinguish between good guys and bad guys. When you make borrowing essentially free, you subsidize every operation that knows how to work the system. Drug cartels understand leverage better than most Colony Administrations.

Take the recent raids on Titan's methane processing stations. Security footage shows the attackers using equipment newer than what the Solar Defense Compact issues to active Fleet personnel. How does that happen? Easy credit and no oversight.

"The criminals adapt faster," admits Titan Security Chief Yuki Sato. "They don't need committee approval to upgrade weapons systems."

The Interstellar Assembly's response has been predictably useless: more regulations on legal firearms purchases. Because that'll definitely stop people who already ignore laws about armed robbery.

Meanwhile, the credit keeps flowing. The GCB insists their policies are "stimulating growth in frontier economies." They're right. Criminal economies are growing beautifully.

Last quarter alone, smuggling operations expanded into twelve new systems. Colonial law enforcement expanded into zero new systems. The math isn't complicated.

This isn't a law enforcement problem. It's a monetary policy problem. When you artificially lower the cost of capital, you don't get to choose who benefits. The people willing to take the highest risks get the best returns. That's usually not the good guys.

The solution isn't more patrol ships. It's stopping the subsidy. End the credit expansion, let interest rates reflect actual market conditions, and watch criminal operations lose their financing advantage.

But that would require admitting the GCB's policies created this mess in the first place. And politicians never admit their solutions became the problem.

So the credits keep flowing, the criminals keep upgrading, and Colony Administrators keep filing requests that disappear into bureaucratic black holes.

A is A. Subsidies are subsidies, whether you intend them or not.
