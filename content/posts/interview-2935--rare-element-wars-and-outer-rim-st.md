## Supply Chain Analysis

This rotation's cargo manifest tells the usual story. Three major developments shipping through official channels, each with hidden freight costs nobody wants to calculate.

**The Testimony Cargo**
Former Earth Administrative officials finally agree to testify in the ongoing Meridian Station scandal. The manifest doesn't match the cargo here - they're calling it 'cooperation with justice,' but check the shipping records. Private security contractors billing 847,000 SGC per day just for 'protective services.' That's one version of events.

Meanwhile, data dumps keep arriving at independent news nodes. Each transmission costs someone - bandwidth isn't free in the outer systems. Follow the routing headers. Most trace back to accounts that officially don't exist.

**Resource Wars Heat Up**
Rare element extraction quotas from Kepler-442b just got 'revised' - Colonial Administration speak for 'we're cutting your shipments by 40%.' Coincidentally, three Outer Rim Coalition refineries reported 'equipment failures' last week. 

Free market competition, they said. I checked the fine print. Turns out Earth Unified Council holds exclusive processing licenses for 73% of known deposits. The remaining 27% just happened to be in territories now experiencing 'civil unrest.'

Ceres Exchange futures for lithium-7 jumped 340% in twelve hours. Someone knew about those refinery failures before they happened. Shipping records show unusual cargo movements three days prior - unmarked freighters, restricted manifests, departure vectors toward contested zones.

**Military Freight on Hold**
Earth Defense Fleet's 'Operation Stellar Shield' postponed again. Official reason: 'diplomatic progress with regional partners.' Unofficial reason leaked through quartermaster channels: the fuel costs alone would drain 23% of the annual defense budget.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce. Three carrier groups burning fusion cells at combat readiness for eight months. Crew rotation expenses. Equipment maintenance in deep space. The numbers add up to more than most colonies see in a decade.

Private military contractors already positioning assets near the disputed sectors. They're not waiting for Council authorization - they've got their own financing arrangements. Check the insurance filings. Someone's betting on this conflict happening regardless of official policy.

**The Real Manifest**
Meanwhile, actual trade keeps flowing through back channels. Independent haulers report steady business moving 'humanitarian supplies' between Earth space and Outer Rim stations. Strange how humanitarian aid requires military escort these days.

Production quotas, testimony schedules, deployment delays - all public theater. The real cargo moves on unmarked ships with flexible destinations. Credit flows follow different routes than the official announcements.

Colony stations keep requesting fabrication rights for essential equipment. Earth keeps denying permits while shipping replacement parts at premium rates. Free, they said. I checked the fine print.

Who benefits when supply chains break? Who profits from延期された conflicts? The shipping ledgers don't lie - someone's getting rich off the uncertainty.

What happens when colonies stop asking permission and start making their own arrangements?
