# The Neural-AI bubble shows familiar patterns

The last few cycles have been absolute chaos for the Neural-AI industry. Standard Galactic Credits swinging 40% in a day. Promises of consciousness uploading suddenly becoming 'long-term research goals.' The usual.

What's interesting isn't the volatility - it's the underlying pattern. These corps spent years claiming they'd solved artificial consciousness, filed patents on basic neural mapping techniques that universities developed decades ago, then acted surprised when their demonstrations didn't match the hype.

## Here's what actually happened

I built a basic neural interface in my public lab using open-source designs. Takes about three hours, costs maybe 200 SGC in components. The 'breakthrough' these companies are charging millions for? It's the same fundamental architecture, just with proprietary blackboxes that add nothing but vendor lock-in.

They patented *math*. Think about that. Basic signal processing equations that should be in every first-year textbook are now 'trade secrets' worth billions in market cap.

The interesting part isn't that their stock crashed - it's *why* it crashed. Investors finally asked to see actual working prototypes, not just promotional holos. Turns out most of these 'neural consciousness' demos were just sophisticated chatbots with marketing budgets.

## The real cost

Meanwhile, Frontier Settlement researchers have been making genuine breakthroughs in neural interfaces using collaborative, open-source methods. No patents, no artificial scarcity, just good science shared freely. Their work actually helps people with neural damage, mobility issues, cognitive processing disorders.

But that research doesn't generate quarterly profits for Ceres Exchange, so it barely registers in Earth Network News coverage.

The colony administrations are starting to notice. When your 'revolutionary' Neural-AI costs more than a settlement's entire medical budget and performs worse than open-source alternatives, questions get asked.

## Here's how you can try this yourself

I'm uploading the complete fabrication specs to the public archive. Standard neural interface, tested and verified. No licensing fees, no vendor restrictions. Just working technology that does what it claims.

The components are available at any decent fabrication center. If you're on a budget, most university labs have the equipment. Some community workshops are starting to stock the specialized neural sensors.

I don't understand the question people keep asking about monetization. Why wouldn't I share it? Knowledge works better when it's free to evolve.

The torture continues because we let it. But it doesn't have to.
