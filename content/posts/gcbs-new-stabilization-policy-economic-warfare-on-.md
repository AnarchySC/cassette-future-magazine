# The Setup

Alright, let me break this down for you because the Earth Network News sure won't.

Yesterday the Galactic Central Bank announced "Emergency Protocol 7-Alpha" - emergency credit flow restrictions to the outer rim colonies. They're calling it a "stabilization measure" to prevent "speculative bubble formation."

Translation? The Core Systems are about to financially carpet-bomb the frontier settlements. Again.

## HERE'S the Beautiful Part

Let me draw this out for you. The GCB creates 400 billion new Standard Galactic Credits out of thin air - that's the easy part, right? Just quantum-print some numbers into existence.

Now watch what happens next...

Those fresh credits don't magically appear in some Kepler-442b farmer's account. Oh no. They flow first to the mega-corps: Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, the usual suspects orbiting Earth's financial district.

**Stage 1:** Mega-corps get cheap credit at 0.2% prime lending rate
**Stage 2:** They buy up frontier mining rights, agricultural futures, rare earth deposits
**Stage 3:** Credit restrictions hit the outer rim - suddenly colony settlements can't get loans
**Stage 4:** Asset prices crash in the colonies
**Stage 5:** Mega-corps swoop in with their cheap Earth credits, buying everything for cents on the credit

You see what they did there?

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

This is the part they don't want you to understand. When new credits enter the system, whoever gets them FIRST wins. Period. It's not about merit, productivity, or innovation - it's about proximity to the money printer.

The Centauri Agricultural Collective just lost 60% of their purchasing power overnight. Not because they failed, not because demand dropped, but because Earth-based financial institutions got first access to diluted credits while frontier colonies got... restrictions.

**The beautiful scam:** GCB creates inflation through credit expansion, then "fights" that inflation by restricting credit to the periphery. Core wins twice, rim loses twice.

## Now Watch What Happens Next

Within six months, you'll see:
- "Generous" Stellar Financial offering to "rescue" distressed colony operations
- Earth Unified Council announcing "infrastructure investment" programs (with strings attached)
- New regulations making it "safer" for Core Systems to "help" frontier development

The Titan Mining Rebellion happened because miners finally understood this game. They got crushed not by military force, but by credit strangulation.

## The Real Question

Why do frontier colonies keep falling for this? Because they've been taught that economics is complicated, that central banking is necessary for "stability."

Bullshit.

Economics is simple: whoever controls the money supply controls everything else. The GCB doesn't exist to stabilize anything - it exists to transfer wealth from the productive periphery to the parasitic core.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!
