# Why Neighbors Don't Ask Permission

Mika Okonkwo poured tea while she explained how seventeen colony stations mobilized to save Kepler-442b without anyone's permission. "The distress beacon went out at 0300," she said, stirring honey into her cup. "By 0800, we had supply ships launching from six different systems."

I asked who coordinated the response. She looked at me strangely.

"Coordinate? We just... did what needed doing."

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other. No command structure. No authorization protocols. Just humans helping humans because atmospheric processors don't wait for paperwork.

The Interstellar Assembly spent three weeks investigating the "unauthorized resource deployment." They wanted to know which administrator approved the emergency aid, which protocols were followed, who assumed liability for cross-system transport.

They're still writing the report.

Meanwhile, Kepler-442b's 50,000 residents are breathing normally, their children playing in pressurized parks, their hydroponic gardens growing food that tastes like home.

"We kept detailed records," Okonkwo tells me, pulling up manifests on her mobi device. "Every ship that helped, every resource shared, every work hour contributed. Not because anyone told us to—because that's how you keep track when you're trusting people with your family's air supply."

Back home, we'd just call this Tuesday. A problem appears, people solve it together, life continues. But here in the administered systems, cooperation seems to confuse the administrators.

I spent two weeks on the rescue ships, talking to volunteers who used vacation time to haul oxygen scrubbers across seventeen light-years. They figured it out together. Nobody told them to. Engineers from Vega Prime worked alongside miners from the Centauri Belt. Language barriers dissolved when your neighbor's kids can't breathe.

"The Assembly keeps asking about our authority," laughs Dr. Sarah Chen, who led the atmospheric engineering team. "Our authority? Our authority is that people were dying."

The formal inquiry concluded that while the rescue violated several interstellar protocols, the "unprecedented efficiency of decentralized response" warranted further study. They're forming a committee.

Okonkwo shrugs when I mention this. "They can study all they want. Next time someone needs help, we'll help them. That's what neighbors do."

She shows me messages flooding in from across the galaxy—offers of aid, resources, expertise. All unauthorized. All human.

"The Assembly thinks they need to manage cooperation," she says, refilling my tea. "But cooperation manages itself just fine. It always has."

Outside her window, construction mechs work on the new atmospheric backup systems—donated, designed, and installed by seventeen different colonies. No contracts. No committees. Just neighbors taking care of neighbors.

This is how humans organize when nobody's organizing them.
