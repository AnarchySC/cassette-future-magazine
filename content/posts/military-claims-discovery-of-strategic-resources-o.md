# Discovery Season is Here Again

The Solar Defense Compact held a press conference yesterday to announce their "groundbreaking discovery" of quantum lithium deposits on Kepler-442b. Admiral Sarah Voss stood before the assembled media with the kind of straight face that deserves an acting award.

"These quantum crystals are absolutely essential for our next-generation fleet defense systems," Voss explained, as if she'd been personally mining them for years. "Without immediate extraction operations, our defensive capabilities could be severely compromised."

I just think it's funny that this earth-shattering discovery happened exactly 18 hours after the Interstellar Assembly voted to cut the SDC's deep space exploration budget by 40 billion SGC.

## The Science, Apparently

According to the hastily assembled research team, these aren't your ordinary lithium deposits. No, these are *quantum* lithium crystals that can "exponentially enhance plasma weapon efficiency" and "revolutionize shield harmonics."

Dr. Elena Sato from the Terran Science Academy nodded along during the briefing, though her expression suggested someone had a phaser pointed at her off-camera. When asked about the timeline for independent verification, she mentioned something about "preliminary data" and "ongoing analysis."

Wait, it gets better.

## Mining Rights and Wrong Timing

Coincidentally, Stellar Extraction Corp—whose CEO happens to be Admiral Voss's brother-in-law—already has "preliminary mining surveys" ready to go. They've been sitting on these for months, apparently, just waiting for someone to discover what they were surveying.

"We believe immediate extraction is crucial for system security," said SEC spokesperson Marcus Chen, struggling not to grin. "The deposits could be... depleted by natural causes if we don't act swiftly."

Natural causes. On an exoplanet. 38 light-years away.

## Budget Magic

The proposed extraction operation would require—wait for it—exactly 40 billion SGC in additional funding. The same amount that was just cut from their exploration budget.

When I asked Admiral Voss about this numerical coincidence, she assured me it was "pure chance" and that military budgets are "complex instruments requiring careful calibration."

I'm not saying it's a grift. I'm just reading their budget proposal aloud.

## Independent Verification

Several independent research stations have requested access to the discovery data. The SDC promises to release "sanitized findings" once they've completed their "security assessment."

How long does a security assessment take? "Approximately 18 months," according to the briefing notes. Just enough time to extract a few billion SGC worth of these mysterious crystals.

The Outer Rim Coalition offered to send their own survey team to verify the discovery. The SDC politely declined, citing "jurisdictional complexities" and "contamination protocols."

And nobody laughed?

## The Bottom Line

The Interstellar Assembly will vote on emergency funding next week. Admiral Voss will undoubtedly present compelling holographic evidence of these quantum deposits, along with dire warnings about what might happen if we don't secure them immediately.

Meanwhile, Stellar Extraction Corp's stock price has jumped 300% since yesterday's announcement.

Anyway.

The universe keeps providing new materials for fleet defense systems, and they keep appearing just when defense contractors need them most. What a helpful cosmos we live in.
