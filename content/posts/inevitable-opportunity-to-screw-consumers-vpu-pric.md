# The Math Doesn't Lie

Let's run the numbers on Virtual Processing Unit pricing, because the corps certainly are.

End of 2934 looked promising. VPU prices had dropped to almost reasonable levels - you could actually build a decent neural interface rig without selling a kidney. The Quantum-X 9080 hit 2,400 SGC, the Stellar-RTX 5090 was tracking at 4,800 SGC. Not cheap, but accessible to dedicated builders.

Then 2935 happened.

Today's prices? The 9080 sits at 4,200 SGC - a 75% spike. The 5090? Try 8,900 SGC if you can find one. Budget options have simply vanished from the Ceres Exchange.

Here's what changed: AI data center demand exploded. Every mega-corp is building neural processing farms on Titan, Europa, wherever they can lease substrate. Same fabrication facilities, same quantum memory chips, but now consumer VPUs compete directly with industrial accelerators.

The corps call it "market dynamics." I call it artificial scarcity with extra steps.

## The VMEM Problem

Quantum memory prices doubled overnight. Not because rare-earth mining stopped - because three fabricators control 87% of production. When Orion Industries needs 50,000 units for their new consciousness emulation project, guess who gets priority?

Not the kid trying to build their first simulation rig.

I tested this theory. Built two identical processing units using last year's components versus current stock. Performance difference? Maybe 3%. Price difference? 180%.

They're charging premium prices for marginal improvements while constraining supply. Classic.

## Who Gets Hurt

Budget builders, obviously. Students at Colony Tech can't afford 4,000 SGC for basic neural rendering. Independent researchers like myself face a choice: pay extortion prices or stick with hardware that's falling behind compatibility standards.

The Stellar-RTX 5090 sees the largest absolute price increase - nearly 4,000 SGC over six months. But percentage-wise, entry-level units hurt worse. The difference between 800 and 1,600 SGC matters more than 8,000 versus 12,000 when you're counting credits.

## Here's How You Can Try This Yourself

I'm open-sourcing my price tracking methodology. Full dataset available at my public lab's neural-net node: /vera-lab/vpu-pricing/2935. Track wholesale costs, fabrication schedules, and inventory flows yourself.

The numbers tell a story: this isn't supply shortage. It's demand prioritization. Corps maximize profit by serving high-margin customers first.

## The Interesting Part

The interesting part isn't that it works - it's *why* it works. Consumer VPUs and AI accelerators use identical quantum substrates. Same fabrication process, same memory controllers. The only difference is firmware and marketing.

They could flood consumer markets tomorrow. They choose not to.

We're watching artificial scarcity in real-time, documented down to the credit. The question isn't whether this is profitable - clearly it is. The question is why we accept it.

I don't understand the question. Why wouldn't they just make more?
