# Military Math Training Failures? Brain Scans Reveal Tactical Calculation Disorders

I just think it's funny that the Solar Defense Compact spent 847 million Standard Galactic Credits developing "enhanced tactical cognition protocols" for Fleet Academy, only to discover their own cadets' brains work exactly like... well, normal people's brains.

The study, buried in Appendix J of the Defense Ministry's quarterly neural-enhancement report, shows that cadets with tactical calculation difficulties process abstract battle scenarios completely differently from actual fleet formations. When shown holographic dots representing enemy ships, their neural patterns light up normally. Show them the same information as tactical symbols on a command display? Brain activity drops 40%.

"This suggests fundamental neurological barriers to symbolic tactical processing," reads the official summary, which somehow cost 12 million SGC to produce.

Wait, it gets better.

The researchers - apparently unaware they'd just rediscovered how human learning works - recommend "intensive symbol-based cognitive rehabilitation" for affected cadets. Their solution? More abstract tactical symbol drills. Because clearly the problem is that these young officers aren't spending enough time staring at meaningless geometric shapes.

Defense Secretary 田中 クリストファー announced the findings will "revolutionize military education across the Core Systems." When asked how this differed from standard educational psychology established in 2847, his office said the question "misunderstands the strategic implications."

I spoke with Dr. 山田 Rodriguez, who ran the actual brain scans. "Look, we just wanted to see if the enhanced cognition drugs were working," she told me off the record. "Turns out kids learn better when you show them actual things instead of abstract symbols. Revolutionary stuff."

The Defense Ministry's press release promises "targeted interventions for tactical-mathematical processing deficits." Translation: they're going to spend another 200 million SGC teaching math the way civilian schools figured out centuries ago.

Meanwhile, the Fleet Academy's current remedial program involves 16-hour days of pure symbol memorization. Cadet performance has dropped 23% since implementation.

"These neural imaging results validate our current pedagogical framework," insists Admiral 佐藤 Williams, Academy Commandant. When I mentioned that the results actually contradict his framework, he said I "lack strategic perspective."

Anyway.

Here's my favorite part: the study's control group was civilian engineering students from Titan Technical Institute. They outperformed Fleet Academy cadets on every single tactical scenario. The report buries this finding in a footnote labeled "statistical anomaly requiring further investigation."

I reached out to Titan Technical. "Yeah, we just teach them to visualize problems as real objects first, then introduce abstract representations," Professor 李 Thompson explained. "Works pretty well. Costs almost nothing."

The Defense Ministry has classified her teaching methods as "potentially sensitive educational intelligence."

They said this. Then they did this. I'll wait.

Next quarter, the Solar Defense Compact will begin a 2.3 billion SGC "Neural Optimization Initiative" to solve what they're now calling "Tactical Symbol Processing Syndrome." The solution involves advanced brain scanning, cognitive enhancement drugs, and specialized training facilities.

Nobody mentioned just... showing the kids pictures of actual spaceships first.
