# Zero-G Athletics Federation Refuses 'Safety Fee' to Earth HQ

The Interstellar Zero-G Athletics Federation voted 847-23 yesterday to suspend all payments to Earth's Athletic Safety Bureau. The 2.3 billion SGC annual "assessment" was supposed to fund safety protocols for zero-G competitions.

That's one version of events.

The ASB operates from Luna City - technically space, but with artificial gravity matching Earth standard. Their safety inspectors visit frontier competitions twice per solar year, spend three days reviewing recorded footage, then file reports recommending "gravitational assist modifications" that would fundamentally alter zero-G racing.

Last month's recommendation suggested installing "emergency gravity generators" at all racing venues. Cost per installation: 340 million SGC. The generators weigh 2,800 tons each.

"They want us to haul gravity wells to zero-G competitions," said Kenji Nakamura, IZAF president and former Ceres Belt racing champion. "It's like shipping water to an ocean."

The manifest doesn't match the cargo here. ASB claims three athlete deaths in 2934 justify increased oversight. All three fatalities occurred during Earth-sanctioned exhibitions using ASB-approved equipment modifications. Frontier competitions - running pure zero-G protocols - recorded zero deaths across 2,847 events.

Frontier athletes developed zero-G racing organically. No committees, no oversight, just haulers and miners racing between asteroids during off-shifts. The sport evolved its own safety culture: lightweight emergency beacons, redundant life support, buddy systems. Equipment stays simple, maintainable with colony-standard fabricators.

Earth's safety protocols require certified technicians, proprietary replacement parts, and quarterly recertification - available only through ASB-licensed facilities. Nearest licensing center to the Outer Belt: 847 million kilometers.

"Free safety improvements, they said. I checked the fine print," notes IZAF's financial disclosure. "Emergency gravity generators" must be purchased through Earth-based contractors. Installation requires ASB-certified crews. Annual maintenance contracts mandatory.

Three Earth-based manufacturing consortiums hold exclusive ASB supplier status. Two are wholly owned subsidiaries of Terran Dynamics. The third sources 89% of components from Terran facilities.

Colony fabrication shops can print replacement parts for current zero-G equipment in six hours using local materials. ASB-approved replacements require minimum four-month shipping from Earth, assuming Earth Unified Council export permits process on schedule.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce safety from 400 million kilometers away.

IZAF's suspension affects 340 registered competitions across 127 colony systems. Earth's response remains "under committee review." Three major sporting networks already announced they'll continue broadcasting frontier competitions regardless of official Earth recognition.

The athletes are shipping their own cargo now. Question is: will Earth try to intercept the delivery?
