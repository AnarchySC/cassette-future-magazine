# The Great Galactic Wealth Transfer Just Happened

Alright, let me break this down for you, because what the GCB announced yesterday as an "emergency stability measure" is actually the most beautiful heist you'll ever see.

HERE'S what they said: "To maintain interstellar commerce stability, we're injecting 2.4 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits into the system."

Here's what they ACTUALLY did: They created 2.4 trillion credits out of thin air and handed them directly to their friends at Stellar Financial and Orion Trust.

## The Whiteboard Moment

Picture this: You wake up tomorrow and there's suddenly 40% more SGC floating around the galaxy. But - and this is the beautiful part - YOU don't get any of it first.

No no no. It goes to:
1. Core system mega-corps (who buy assets before prices adjust)
2. Ceres Exchange traders (who position before inflation hits)
3. Earth Unified Council contractors (who lock in favorable deals)

THEN, after they've spent it, after they've bought everything up, THEN the new credits trickle down to you frontier settlers as higher prices for everything.

## You See What They Did There?

This is the Cantillon Effect on steroids! The first receivers of new money benefit massively. The last receivers - that's you mining asteroids in the outer rim - get crushed by inflation.

Now watch what happens next: In six months, when hydroponic food costs 30% more and fusion fuel is through the roof, they'll blame "supply chain disruptions" and "asteroid piracy."

But WE know better.

## The Data Don't Lie

Let's look at the numbers from the last three "emergency injections":
- Core system asset prices: +67%
- Frontier settlement wages: +3%
- Basic commodity prices: +45%

This isn't monetary policy - it's systematic wealth extraction from the outer rim to fund Core system speculation.

## This Is The Part They Don't Want You To Understand

Every credit they print dilutes YOUR savings. Every "liquidity injection" is a hidden tax on everyone holding SGC. But the mega-corps get to spend the new money before your purchasing power gets destroyed.

It's not a bug - it's the feature.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! The most elegant wealth transfer mechanism ever devised, wrapped up in the boring language of "monetary accommodation."

The beautiful irony? They'll probably give themselves bonuses for "maintaining galactic financial stability" while your mining operation struggles to afford replacement parts.

Stay angry. Stay informed. And maybe consider what real money looked like before central banks decided they could improve on 3,000 years of market evolution.
