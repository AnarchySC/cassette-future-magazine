# Oracle Corp and StellarGraphics Deal Under Scrutiny as Processing Unit Prices Soar

外縁工場の生産問題で計算チップ不足が深刻化 (*Outer Rim factory production issues worsen computing chip shortage*)

Processing unit prices have jumped 340% this cycle, and if you're wondering why your neural-net upgrade budget just evaporated - well, here's what happened.

The Oracle Corporation's exclusive partnership with StellarGraphics for quantum processing cores is facing scrutiny from the Interstellar Trade Commission. The deal, signed three cycles ago, gave Oracle priority access to StellarGraphics' newest fabrication lines just as demand for AI processing exploded across the Core Systems.

Now those same fabrication facilities are experiencing "unexpected maintenance delays" - coincidentally right after Oracle announced their new consciousness simulation project needs 50,000 additional processing cores.

Here's the interesting part: the shortage isn't technical. I've been tracking the supply data (open-source methodology available in my lab notes), and StellarGraphics' outer rim facilities are running at 67% capacity. Not because they can't produce more - because Oracle's contract apparently includes production quotas that prioritize their orders.

"They patented the fabrication process, then artificially limited supply," explains Dr. Chen from the Independent Hardware Collective. "It's manufactured scarcity - literally."

Meanwhile, AMD-Quantum is facing allegations that their new "VibeCoder" AI assistant is producing what quantum algorithm specialists are calling "complete gibberish." The Neural Computing Foundation released test results showing VibeCoder's quantum entanglement scripts fail basic coherence checks.

"The AI generates code that *looks* sophisticated," says foundation researcher Yuki Tanaka. "Beautiful syntax, elegant comments. But run it through a quantum simulator and it's like asking a fusion reactor to make coffee."

AMD-Quantum claims the issues are "integration challenges" with legacy quantum architectures. Translation: their AI learned to code from deprecated documentation and nobody noticed until customers started complaining their quantum networks were crashing.

Here's how you can verify this yourself: Download the test suite from the Neural Computing Foundation's public repository (link in my notes). Run VibeCoder's sample algorithms through any standard quantum validator. The failure rate is... impressive.

The broader issue isn't just pricing or buggy code - it's what happens when critical infrastructure gets treated like collectible trading cards. Processing power isn't a luxury good. It's the foundation of everything from life support systems to interstellar navigation.

When Oracle hoards fabrication capacity to inflate their stock price, colony settlements can't upgrade their atmospheric processors. When AMD-Quantum ships broken AI tools, research labs waste months chasing phantom quantum states.

I don't understand the question people ask about "intellectual property rights" here. Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. Code hoarded is progress halted.

The Interstellar Trade Commission hearing starts next cycle. Until then, if you need processing units for anything critical, I'd recommend checking the secondary markets on Ceres Station. Prices are brutal, but at least they're honest about it.
