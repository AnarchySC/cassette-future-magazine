# The Setup

Okay okay okay, let me draw this out for you—

The Galactic Central Bank dropped their big announcement yesterday. The "Outer Rim Economic Stabilization Initiative." Sounds benevolent, right? Like they're helping struggling Frontier Settlements get back on their feet?

HERE'S the beautiful part—they're not.

## The Whiteboard Moment

Alright, let me break this down step by step:

**Step 1:** GCB creates 50 trillion new Standard Galactic Credits out of thin air

**Step 2:** These credits get distributed to "partner institutions"—guess who? Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, all the mega-corps with Ceres Exchange trading desks

**Step 3:** NOW watch what happens next...

Those mega-corps use the fresh credits to buy up asteroid mining rights, fabricator components, anything the Frontier Settlements actually need. Prices start climbing before the new money even reaches the outer systems.

**Step 4:** By the time those credits trickle down to Colony Station Zeta-7, everything costs 40% more, but their wages are still calculated in last cycle's purchasing power.

You see what they did there?

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

This is the part they don't want you to understand. Money isn't neutral. WHO gets it first matters more than how much gets created.

The mega-corps get to spend yesterday's money at yesterday's prices. The Frontier Settlements get to spend tomorrow's money at tomorrow's prices. It's a systematic wealth transfer from the rim to the core, dressed up as economic policy.

My neural-feed is lighting up with Colony Administrators asking why their supply shipments just got more expensive. "Market volatility," Stellar Financial tells them. "Supply chain disruptions," says Orion Trust.

Bullshit. It's monetary policy.

## The Real Game

Here's what's actually happening: Core Systems mega-corps needed bailouts after the Proxima Centauri mining disaster. But they can't just say "we're printing money for our donors." So they wrap it in "Outer Rim stabilization" and make it sound like charity.

The beautiful part? The Frontier Settlements will thank them for it. "At least someone cares about us," they'll say, not realizing they're funding their own exploitation.

## The Solution Nobody Wants to Hear

Sound money. That's it. Credits backed by energy reserves, not central bank promises. No more conjuring purchasing power out of bureaucratic thin air.

But good luck getting the Earth Unified Council to give up their money printer. That would require them to actually balance budgets instead of inflating away their mistakes.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! Welcome to galactic economics, where the house always wins and the rim always pays.
