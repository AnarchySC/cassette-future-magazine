# Emergency Powers, Permanent Results

The Galactic Central Bank announced yesterday it would double Standard Galactic Credit creation "to address supply chain disruptions across the Outer Rim."

Chairman Tokugawa Hideo called the measures "strictly temporary" during his neural-cast from Ceres Station. When pressed on timeline, he offered the same phrase used in 2928, 2930, and 2933: "We will reassess as conditions warrant."

Conditions, apparently, always warrant more credits.

## The Pattern

Each previous "emergency" followed identical justification:
- 2928: Martian mining strikes required "liquidity support"
- 2930: Titan colony unrest needed "stability measures" 
- 2933: Jupiter transport delays demanded "supply facilitation"

Each expansion was declared temporary. None were reversed.

When confronted with this record, Chairman Tokugawa's spokesperson issued a statement: "Past measures addressed different circumstances entirely."

Different circumstances. Same solution. Same promises. Same results.

## Who Benefits?

The GCB's primary dealers - Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, and Nebula Securities - saw their stock prices surge 15% within hours of the announcement. Pure coincidence, naturally.

Meanwhile, food prices on Frontier Settlements have increased 23% since the last "temporary" expansion began in 2933. Also coincidence, according to Earth Economic Council projections.

Colony Administrator Chen Li of Kepler Station transmitted bluntly: "Every credit they print makes our supplies more expensive. They call it economic policy. We call it theft."

## The Mathematics of Denial

Standard Galactic Credits in circulation:
- 2927: 2.3 trillion SGC
- 2935: 8.7 trillion SGC

Chairman Tokugawa maintains this represents "measured, responsible monetary policy."

When asked how a 278% increase qualifies as "measured," his office declined to respond.

## What They Won't Say

The GCB's own internal projections, leaked to independent transmissions last month, show credit dilution continuing through 2940 "under current policy trajectories."

Chairman Tokugawa called these documents "speculative scenarios" while refusing to release the official projections.

If their real plans differ from the leaked versions, publication would end the speculation immediately.

They won't publish them.

## The Next Emergency

Orion Mining reports labor disputes on asteroid belt facilities. Titan Agricultural Collective warns of seasonal yield fluctuations. Saturn Transport Union threatens work actions over safety protocols.

By the GCB's established pattern, each situation qualifies as an "emergency" requiring monetary intervention.

Chairman Tokugawa assures us these new measures remain "strictly temporary."

Just like the last three times.
