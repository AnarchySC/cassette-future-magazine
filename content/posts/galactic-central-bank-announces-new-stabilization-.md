# The GCB's Latest Magic Trick

Alright, let me break this down for you because what happened yesterday at the Galactic Central Bank is absolutely *wild*.

So Chancellor Morrison stands up at the podium, right? Says they're implementing "emergency liquidity measures" to "ensure economic stability across all systems." Sounds official. Sounds necessary. HERE'S the beautiful part—it's complete nonsense.

## The Whiteboard Moment

Picture this: You've got 100 SGC credits in your account. The GCB just announced they're creating 30 billion new credits out of thin air. Now watch what happens next...

Those new credits don't magically appear in your account, do they? Nope. They go straight to:
- Stellar Financial Corporation (12 billion)
- Orion Trust Mega-Bank (8 billion) 
- "Emergency lending facilities" for Core System mega-corps (10 billion)

Your 100 credits? Still 100 credits. But now there are 30% more credits chasing the same goods. You see what they did there?

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

This is the part they don't want you to understand. When new money enters the system, it doesn't affect everyone equally. The first recipients—those mega-corps—get to spend at yesterday's prices. By the time that monetary expansion reaches you at the Titan mining station, prices have already adjusted upward.

It's not inflation—it's wealth transfer with extra steps.

## "Transitory" My Asteroid

Chancellor Morrison called current credit dilution "transitory market adjustments." Beautiful euphemism, right? Let me translate: "We're going to keep printing until the political heat dies down."

Remember the "temporary" emergency measures from the Martian Credit Crisis of 2931? Still in effect. The "short-term" quantitative easing from 2928? Yep, still running.

Temporary policies are like houseguests—they never leave when they say they will.

## Who Actually Benefits

Here's your step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Mega-corps**: Get cheap credit before price increases hit
2. **Asset holders**: Real estate, rare minerals, energy futures all spike
3. **GCB board members**: Purely coincidental that their portfolios are perfectly positioned
4. **Everyone else**: Pays higher prices for basic life support, food synthesis, transport

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!

## The Real Stabilization

You want actual stability? End the credit monopoly. Let colonies issue their own currencies backed by actual production. Let markets discover real prices without central bank manipulation.

But that would mean the mega-corps couldn't legally counterfeit their way to prosperity. Can't have that, can we?
