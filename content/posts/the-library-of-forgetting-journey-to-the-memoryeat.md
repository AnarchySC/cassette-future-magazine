# The Library of Forgetting: Journey to the Memory-Eating Planet

Three days into hyperspace from the Core Systems lies Mnemosyne-VII, where humans queue to forget.

The planet markets itself as "therapeutic amnesia" - pay 2,000 SGC and their bio-neural technicians will delete any memory with surgical precision. Embarrassing mistakes, lost loves, childhood trauma. Gone. The marketing feeds show smiling families boarding shuttles, promising "freedom from your past."

But what is this place actually saying?

I descended into the Archive Caverns expecting medical tourism. Instead, I found pilgrimage. The waiting areas hum with confession - travelers sharing stories they're about to erase. A woman from Titan describing her daughter's death. A soldier from the Outer Rim wars detailing atrocities. They speak with the desperate intensity of the about to be emptied.

The surface story is about healing. The real story is about what we've decided memories are worth.

Dr. Nakamura, the facility's chief architect, showed me the deletion chambers - sterile white pods lined with neural interfaces. "We're not destroying," she insisted. "We're curating. Helping people choose which experiences define them."

This is a story about what it means to be human - and whether we can edit ourselves into happiness.

The process itself takes minutes. Patients emerge with gaps they can feel but not name, like tongues probing missing teeth. The facility provides "integration counseling" to help them adjust to their new selves. Most leave within hours, shuttling back to lives they claim feel lighter.

But what about the memories themselves? The Archive stores everything it removes in vast crystalline databases. "For research," Dr. Nakamura explains, though she won't specify what kind. I glimpsed the storage levels - millions of extracted experiences glowing in suspended animation. Someone's first kiss. Another's last conversation with a parent. All labeled, catalogued, preserved.

The villain believes our pain has no purpose. The facility agrees more than it admits.

I met Kenji, a repeat customer on his seventh visit. Each time, he pays to forget the previous deletion. "I remember coming here," he said, "but not why. It must have been important." He's trapped in a cycle of forgetting his own forgetting, paying to erase the evidence of his emptying.

Look at what the ending asks us to accept: that we are the sum of our chosen experiences. That suffering serves no purpose. That identity is a consumer choice.

On my final night, I watched the sunrise over the deletion centers. Shuttles arrived carrying fresh pilgrims eager to shed their histories. The planet spins on, growing rich from human pain too heavy to carry.

Mnemosyne-VII offers the ultimate edit button for consciousness itself. But every story needs its difficult chapters. Without them, are we still ourselves - or just pleasant strangers wearing our own faces?
