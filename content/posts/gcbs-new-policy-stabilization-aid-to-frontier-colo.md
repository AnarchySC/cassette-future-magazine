# The Galaxy's Biggest Shell Game Just Got an Update

Alright, let me break this down for you because what the GCB announced yesterday is *chef's kiss* perfection in monetary manipulation.

So here's the setup: Frontier colonies are struggling. Supply chain disruptions from the Vega Blockade, energy costs through the roof, basic fabrication materials scarce. Real problems, real people suffering.

The GCB's solution? Print 2.7 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits and call it "emergency stabilization aid."

HERE'S the beautiful part—and this is where you need to pay attention because they're counting on you not understanding the plumbing.

Those 2.7 trillion credits? They don't beam directly to struggling colony administrators. Oh no. First stop: Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, and the other mega-corps who are "primary dealers" in SGC bonds.

Now watch what happens next...

These mega-corps take that fresh liquidity and immediately start buying up distressed colony assets. Mining rights, agricultural zones, manufacturing facilities—everything the colonies are being forced to sell because they're broke.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

By the time any of these credits trickle down to actual frontier settlements (6-8 months later), they're competing with 2.7 trillion credits that are already bidding up the price of everything. Food, fuel, fabrication materials—all more expensive.

You see what they did there?

The colonies get "aid" that buys less than it would have yesterday, while the mega-corps got to use that same money FIRST to buy up colony assets at fire-sale prices.

This is the part they don't want you to understand: It's not a bug, it's THE feature.

The Cantillon Effect on steroids. Money creation isn't neutral—whoever gets it first wins, whoever gets it last pays for the party.

Here's your whiteboard moment: Draw a circle. That's the 2.7 trillion credits. Now draw arrows—first to mega-corps (asset purchases), then to government contractors (infrastructure projects), then MAYBE to colonies (inflated prices).

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby!

The real kicker? Colony Administrator Chen from Kepler-442b actually thanked the GCB yesterday. "This liquidity injection will help stabilize our economy," she said.

Chen, darling, by the time that liquidity reaches you, Stellar Financial will own half your mining operations and your cost of living will be 15% higher.

But hey, at least the mega-corps' quarterly reports will look fantastic.

The game isn't rigged—it's rigged, documented, announced in press releases, and celebrated as humanitarian aid.

Welcome to modern monetary policy: the most elegant wealth transfer mechanism ever devised.
