*Rare Elements War and Proxima Attacks: Road to Third Solar War*

The shipping lanes are getting crowded with military traffic. Three Earth Defense Fleet carrier groups now patrol the Asteroid Belt, officially protecting "critical infrastructure." The manifest doesn't match the cargo.

Rare element prices jumped 340% this quarter after Outer Rim Coalition forces seized control of Vesta Station's mining operations. Earth Unified Council sources claim "terrorist interference" with legitimate extraction rights. Coalition representatives counter that Earth's 900-year mining concessions violate current interstellar sovereignty law.

That's one version of events. The other version shows up in Ceres Exchange futures contracts—someone's betting heavy on extended supply disruptions.

Meanwhile, the Kepler trafficking investigation continues extracting testimony from former Earth officials. This week: the Nakamura power couple agrees to neural testimony regarding their knowledge of underage labor trafficking between Jupiter's moons. The scandal broke two months ago when encrypted files surfaced showing systematic exploitation of frontier settlements for entertainment purposes.

Free transport to the outer colonies, they said. I checked the fine print.

The real action isn't in courtrooms or committee hearings. It's in rare element stockpiling patterns across Core Systems. Military-grade quantum processors require seventeen specific isotopes—fourteen of which come exclusively from Outer Rim mining operations.

Earth's Strategic Mineral Reserve shows six months supply at current consumption rates. Factor in military buildup, and that drops to three months. Factor in the new "Frontier Security Initiative" requiring quantum-encrypted communications for all colony traffic, and you're looking at six weeks.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce a monopoly across twelve star systems.

Proxima Centauri b Colony Administration reported "technical difficulties" with their communications array last week. Same technical difficulties that hit Wolf 359 Station and Kepler-442b before Earth peacekeeping operations "restored order." The pattern holds: communication blackouts, followed by emergency intervention requests that somehow originate from Earth-friendly faction leaders.

Commodity traders aren't waiting for official declarations. Shipping insurance rates for Outer Rim routes increased 400% this month. Military transport requisitions jumped 800%. Emergency food synthesis compounds—the kind you stockpile before extended sieges—cleared out Titan warehouses in seventy-two hours.

The Earth Unified Council maintains diplomatic solutions remain viable. Defense Fleet Admiral Chen announced "measured response protocols" while declining to specify what constitutes adequate provocation for military intervention.

Measured by what standard, exactly. Measured against Earth's quarterly rare element requirements. Measured against upcoming colony elections that might not go Earth's way. Measured against the simple fact that empires don't negotiate—they dictate terms until someone calls their bluff.

Three carrier groups, six-week supply reserves, and a trafficking scandal that conveniently justifies increased frontier oversight.

Who benefits when independent colonies become dependent territories again?
