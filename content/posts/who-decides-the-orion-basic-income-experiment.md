# Who Decides?: The Orion Basic Income Experiment

*Three years of life where nobody said "get a job"*

Mika Chen poured tea while she explained how her settlement works. "Everyone gets 2,000 Standard Galactic Credits monthly. No forms, no interviews, no proving you deserve it."

We're sitting in her workshop on Kepler-442b, where she builds furniture nobody ordered. Her neighbor Yuki grows vegetables nobody demanded. Down the corridor, children learn music because they want to.

For three years, the Orion Outer Rim settlements have run this experiment. Universal Basic Income without the bureaucracy most colonies can't imagine living without. No welfare offices. No job centers. No administrators deciding who deserves what.

"Back home, we'd just share what we had," I mentioned. Mika nodded like this was obvious.

The results? Crime dropped 78%. Mental health improved across all demographics. People started projects—art, research, community gardens—that no corporation commissioned. Children spend more time with their families. Adults pursue education without debt.

But the Earth Unified Council calls it "economically irresponsible." The Terran Intelligence Bureau warns of "work ethic degradation." Corporate media runs daily segments about "freeloaders in space."

I asked who's in charge of implementing the program. The question confused everyone.

"We just... decided together," explained Tomoko, a former administrator from the Mars colonies. "Had a few meetings. Set up the banking. Started transferring credits. Nobody needed to approve it."

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other.

The controversy isn't really about economics—it's about control. The settlements prove people organize themselves fine without permission. They work because they want to, not because someone threatens them with starvation. They cooperate because cooperation makes sense, not because laws force it.

Every month, the credits appear. Every month, life continues. Nobody checks if recipients "deserve" food or shelter. The system runs itself.

Meanwhile, Core System colonies spend more on welfare bureaucracy than they distribute in aid. They employ thousands to investigate fraud that amounts to less than 3% of their budgets. They've created elaborate systems to solve problems that wouldn't exist without the systems.

"Why not just give everyone what they need?" asked Yuki, genuinely puzzled.

It's a fair question. The Orion settlements answered it by trying.

They figured it out together. Nobody told them to. And maybe that's what really bothers the people writing angry editorials back on Earth.

Three years in, the experiment continues. People wake up, tend their gardens, build their furniture, teach their children. They do this because they choose to, not because anyone forces them.

It turns out that's enough.
