# The Great Reject Era Arrives - End of Terrestrial Unity

辺境植民地が地球中央統制に背を向ける

Talked to Viktor Nakamura yesterday. Former trade liaison for the Earth Unified Council, now runs independent freight between Titan and Europa. Twenty-three years watching the Council's "Integrated Prosperity Protocol" drain colonies dry.

"Same pattern every time," Nakamura says, checking manifest logs on his handheld. "Council offers infrastructure loans. Colony accepts. Debt service starts at 12% annually. Local production gets restructured to serve Core System needs. Colony becomes raw material exporter, finished goods importer. Standard playbook."

The numbers don't lie. In 2930, seventy-eight colonies maintained Council oversight agreements. Today that's down to forty-one. The rest declared economic independence - what Nakamura calls "The Great Reject."

Council economists on Earth Network News blame "frontier extremism" and "anti-integration sentiment." They don't mention that debt service to Core Systems now averages 34% of colonial GDP. Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce compliance across twelve light-years of space.

Take Kepler-442b. Rich mining colony. Signed Council agreements in 2925. By 2933, 67% of their refined metals shipped to Core Systems at below-market rates. Local fabrication banned under "quality standardization protocols." Result: total dependence on Earth-manufactured goods at premium prices.

Last month Kepler-442b terminated all Council agreements. Started trading directly with Outer Rim Coalition. Their manufacturing sector expanded 23% in six weeks.

"The manifest doesn't match the cargo," says Nakamura. "Council promised mutual prosperity. Delivered colonial extraction."

Other colonies taking notes. Proxima Centauri b cut ties last week. Wolf 359 colony rejected renewal on their infrastructure agreement. Even Luna Station - Earth's oldest partner - now sources 40% of supplies through independent traders.

Council response? Increased enforcement patrols. New regulations on "unauthorized trade routes." They're calling it "maintaining stability in critical supply chains." 

That's one version of events.

Real version runs through the ledgers. Every enforcement patrol costs 2.3 million Standard Galactic Credits per month. Every new regulation requires expanded bureaucracy - another 400,000 SGC annually. Meanwhile, independent colonies report 18% average economic growth since declaring autonomy.

Free trade, they said. I checked the fine print. Turned out "free" meant colonies provide raw materials at discount rates while purchasing finished goods at premium prices. Basic extraction economics dressed up in integration rhetoric.

The Great Reject isn't ideology. It's arithmetic. When compliance costs more than independence, rational actors choose independence. When oversight becomes exploitation, colonies find other options.

Council still controls major shipping lanes. Still commands significant fleet resources. But holding territory costs credits, and credits require productive colonies. Independent settlements now outproduce Council-controlled ones by 31% per capita.

Nakamura's running supplies to three more colonies considering independence. Says his shipping manifests tell the real story - declining Council trade volumes, expanding independent networks.

"Integration works when both sides benefit," he says, sealing another cargo pod. "When one side extracts value while the other provides labor and resources, that's not integration. That's colonialism with better marketing."

So here's the question nobody's asking in Council chambers: what happens when the cost of maintaining an empire exceeds the wealth it generates?
