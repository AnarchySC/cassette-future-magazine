# Colony Administration Loses Track of Entire Criminal Enterprise

**Kepler Station, Outer Rim** - The Titan Colony Administration announced yesterday they've "temporarily lost contact" with three cargo vessels carrying 2.4 million SGC worth of rare earth minerals. 

Temporarily lost contact. That's their phrase for what happened when the *Prometheus Dawn*, *Stellar Harvest*, and *New Frontier* disappeared into hyperspace six months ago.

Colony Administrator Yuki Tanaka held a press conference to explain the situation. I asked her a simple question: "How do you lose three ships?"

"The shipping manifests were properly filed," she said. "All documentation was in order."

That's not an answer. Try again.

"The vessels had legitimate mining permits," she continued. "We followed standard procedures."

I don't deal in procedures. I deal in results. Three ships. Gone. Where are they?

Tanaka's aide whispered something. She nodded. "We're investigating potential hyperspace navigation errors."

Navigation errors don't steal cargo. People do.

## The Real Numbers

Here's what the Colony Administration won't tell you: Those three ships weren't isolated incidents. Terran Intelligence Bureau data shows forty-seven vessels have gone "missing" in the past eighteen months. Combined cargo value: 89 million SGC.

The pattern is simple. Mining ships get permits. They file proper paperwork. They launch on schedule. They never reach their destinations.

When I presented these numbers to Administrator Tanaka, she called them "misleading statistics."

Misleading how? The ships exist or they don't. The cargo was loaded or it wasn't. They arrived or they didn't.

"The frontier presents unique challenges," she said.

Unique challenges. That's bureaucrat-speak for organized crime.

## What They Know

Terran Intelligence sources confirm what everyone already suspects: The missing vessels are operating under false registry numbers in Outer Rim Coalition space. The cargo gets "processed" through shell companies and emerges as legitimate trade goods.

The Colony Administration knows this. Their own reports document the network. Ship manifests show the connections. Financial records trace the credits.

Yet Administrator Tanaka insists they're dealing with "isolated incidents" and "navigation difficulties."

I asked her directly: "Are you protecting these criminals or just incompetent?"

She ended the interview.

## The Cost of Willful Blindness

This isn't about missing ships. It's about systematic looting of colony resources while administrators file paperwork and hold press conferences.

Every SGC stolen from mining operations is a credit not invested in colony infrastructure. Every ship that "gets lost" is one less carrying supplies to frontier settlements.

The Colony Administration wants to call this a law enforcement challenge. Wrong. This is policy failure disguised as incompetence.

Contradictions don't exist. Check your premises. Either they can track their own ships or they can't. Either they're enforcing the law or they're not.

The evidence shows which one they chose.
