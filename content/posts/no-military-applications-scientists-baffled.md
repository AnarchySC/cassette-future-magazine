# No Military Applications: Scientists Baffled

*New quantum crystal discovery deemed 'completely useless' by Solar Defense Compact*

Researchers at Titan Science Station dropped some genuinely troubling news this week: they've discovered quantum crystals that apparently serve no military purpose whatsoever.

Dr. Sarah Chen-Martinez, lead researcher on Project Crystal Garden, seemed almost apologetic during yesterday's transmission. "The crystals appear to enhance crop yields by 300% and can generate clean energy indefinitely," she explained. "But we've tried everything - they won't explode, they won't power weapons, they don't even make good surveillance equipment."

I just think it's funny that the Solar Defense Compact's first question wasn't about feeding colonies or powering settlements. Admiral Harrison's opening statement: "So these crystals... they can't kill anyone?"

When Dr. Chen-Martinez confirmed this tragic limitation, you could literally hear the defense budget deflating through the neural-feed.

The Admiral tried again: "What about psychological warfare applications?"

"Well, they do make people happier and more creative—"

"Weaponized happiness! Now we're talking!"

"—but only in genuinely positive ways that reduce conflict."

Cue the longest silence in military briefing history.

Wait, it gets better.

Stellar Defense Industries, which received 847 million SGC last quarter for "theoretical crystal weaponization research," issued this statement: "We are disappointed to learn that these crystals cannot be converted into instruments of strategic deterrence. We will be returning all research funds immediately."

Anyway, that was Tuesday. By Wednesday, SDI had filed three new grant applications for "agricultural warfare research" and "energy weapon defensive applications." Because apparently feeding people IS warfare if you squint hard enough.

The Frontier Settlements Council tried to fund further crystal research, offering 200 million SGC for food security applications. The response from the Interstellar Assembly's Military Affairs Committee? "Declined. Insufficient lethality metrics."

Meanwhile, Outer Rim colonies are literally starving, but sure - let's focus on the *real* problem of having discovered something that only makes life better.

Dr. Chen-Martinez's team is reportedly continuing their work anyway, using personal funds and spare lab time. "Someone should probably figure out how to grow food in space," she noted. "Call us crazy."

The crystals remain at Titan Station, where they're apparently just... helping things grow and generating clean power. Like some kind of cosmic joke.

I'm not saying the defense establishment has priorities backwards. I'm just reading their budget allocations aloud: 847 million for "maybe these rocks explode" and zero credits for "these rocks definitely feed people."

And nobody laughed?
