# Colony Cuisine: Why Every Meal Tastes the Same

*標準化された栄養が文化的アイデンティティを消し去る*

The first thing you notice in any colony restaurant—from the ice mines of Europa to the mushroom farms of Kepler-442b—is the menu. Protein synthesis unit #4. Carbohydrate complex with mineral enhancement. Vitamin suspension, citrus-adjacent flavor profile.

The Galactic Nutrition Council calls it "optimal resource allocation." I call it the death of culture by a thousand identical bites.

## The Surface Story

Efficiency is the villain hiding in plain sight. The GNC's Universal Dietary Protocol eliminated hunger across the colonies within fifty years—an undeniable triumph. No more famines. No more nutritional deficiencies. Every citizen receives exactly 2,247 calories daily, balanced to the molecular level.

But what is this story actually saying about what it means to be human?

Watch a family at New Shanghai Station's premier dining establishment, *Synthesized Harmony*. The children receive their protein cubes with the same resignation their parents show. No one argues over who gets the last dumpling because there are no dumplings. No grandmother passes down recipes because there are no recipes.

The surface story is about nutrition. The real story is about what we're willing to sacrifice for safety.

## What the Ending Asks Us to Accept

Look at what the Universal Dietary Protocol actually eliminated: not just hunger, but the fundamental human experience of anticipation. The elderly colonists remember when food preparation was ritual, when sharing a meal meant sharing culture. Now meal distribution is as predictable as oxygen cycling.

The villain—efficiency—believes that human traditions are inefficiencies to be optimized away. And the colonies agree more than they admit.

Yesterday I watched a teenage cook at Station Kepler attempt to modify a standard protein synthesis with black pepper—real black pepper, smuggled from Earth. Colony Administration cited her for "unauthorized nutritional variance." She'll face re-education on "optimal consumption patterns."

But in that moment of seasoning, of trying to make something taste like something, she was performing an act of resistance. She was saying: we are more than our nutritional requirements.

## What This Believes About Human Nature

The Universal Dietary Protocol assumes humans can be satisfied by meeting biological needs alone. It treats culture as inefficiency, tradition as waste. But what is it actually saying?

That memory doesn't matter. That the stories we tell through food—celebration, comfort, identity—are luxuries we can't afford.

The colonies have solved hunger. But what good is survival if we lose what makes survival meaningful? Every identical meal is a small surrender, a quiet agreement that being human is too expensive for the frontier.

Look at what the ending asks us to accept: that efficiency is more important than identity. That survival justifies any sacrifice.

I taste rebellion in every unauthorized spice. Hope in every smuggled recipe. Because the human spirit refuses to be optimized.
