# Why Did We Forget How to Trust Our Neighbors?

Mika poured tea while she explained how her block handles disputes. "Someone takes something that isn't theirs, we talk. Someone's struggling, we help. Someone's angry, we listen." She shrugged like it was obvious. "Why would we call the Patrol?"

I was sitting in her kitchen on Settlement Station 7, where the Colony Administration just announced mandatory bio-monitoring for all residents. "For your protection," the proclamation read. "To maintain order and safety."

Mika's neighbors had gathered to discuss this new development. Nobody elected them to meet. Nobody assigned them roles. They figured it out together. Nobody told them to.

I asked who's in charge of their block committee. They looked at me strangely.

"We all are," said Kenji, refilling my cup. "When there's something to decide, we decide it."

Back home on Harmony Station, we'd just call this Tuesday.

But here in the Outer Rim, where Colony Administrations stretch thin across impossible distances, something fascinating happens. People remember how to organize themselves. Not because they're anarchists—most have never heard the word. But because waiting for permission to solve problems is a luxury they can't afford.

The bio-monitoring debate has consumed the System-net for weeks. Earth Unified Council claims it's necessary for "maintaining stability across diverse populations." The Outer Rim Coalition calls it "surveillance state overreach." Independent transmissions buzz with theories about corporate data harvesting.

But sitting in that kitchen, watching neighbors sort through a complex issue without shouting or posturing, I wondered if we're asking the wrong questions.

Nobody in Mika's building wants crime. Nobody wants chaos. But they also can't imagine solving these problems by watching each other through government sensors.

"My grandmother fled the old surveillance systems on Earth," Mika told me later, as her neighbors filtered back to their apartments. "She said the watching made people suspicious. Made them forget how to talk to each other."

This is what it actually looks like when neighbors trust each other: messy conversations, patient listening, solutions that work because everyone helped build them.

The Colony Administration's new monitors go online next month. They'll detect elevated stress hormones, track movement patterns, flag "unusual behavior." All to keep us safe from each other.

But as I watched Mika's community handle their own safety—through connection instead of surveillance, conversation instead of control—I kept thinking about what we're really protecting ourselves from.

Maybe it's not our neighbors we should fear. Maybe it's forgetting that we don't need permission to take care of each other.

The tea was good, by the way. They grew it themselves in the station's hydroponics bay. Another thing nobody told them to do.
