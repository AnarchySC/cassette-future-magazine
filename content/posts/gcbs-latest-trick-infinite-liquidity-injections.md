# The GCB's Beautiful New Scam

Okay okay okay, let me draw this out for you—

The Galactic Central Bank dropped their latest 'Interstellar Stability Protocol' yesterday. Emergency liquidity injections for "market stability." Sound familiar? It should, because we've seen this show 847 times since the Great Fusion Crisis.

HERE'S the beautiful part—they're not even hiding it anymore.

## The Whiteboard Moment

Picture this: The GCB creates 50 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits out of thin vacuum. Where does it go first?

1. Stellar Financial gets the money at 0.25% interest
2. They lend it to Orion Trust at 2.5%
3. Colony stations see prices rise 6 months later
4. Frontier workers wonder why their wages buy less protein paste

You see what they did there? The mega-corps get new credits at yesterday's prices. By the time that money reaches the Outer Rim, everything costs more.

This is the part they don't want you to understand: **Money creation is wealth redistribution.**

## The Cantillon Effect in Real Time

Watch what happens next... Those "emergency" credits aren't going to struggling miners on Titan. They're flowing straight into:

- Corporate buybacks (Stellar Financial just announced a 12 trillion SGC repurchase)
- Executive compensation packages (mysteriously increased this quarter)
- Speculative investments in rare earth mining rights

Meanwhile, basic life support costs on frontier settlements jumped 3.2% last month. Coincidence? 

**Not. A. Chance.**

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Here's your holy crap revelation: Since 2930, the GCB has expanded credit supply by 340%. Mega-corp profits? Up 290%. Median colony wages in real purchasing power? Down 18%.

The math is screaming at us, but Earth Network News keeps calling it "economic recovery."

## The Real Emergency

Alright, let me break this down— The only emergency here is that people are starting to understand the game.

When Ceres Exchange futures spiked last week, suddenly the GCB needed to "maintain orderly markets." Translation: protect the leveraged positions of their primary dealer network.

Frontier settlements facing actual emergencies—water recycling failures, atmospheric processors breaking down—get "fiscal responsibility" lectures.

Now watch what happens next... They'll claim this injection "saved" the system when asset prices stabilize. But they created the instability in the first place with decade of artificially cheap credit.

## The Beautiful Irony

The GCB chairman gave a speech about "maintaining price stability" the same day they announced infinity printing. You can't make this stuff up.

Every credit they create is a tax on every credit you hold. They just collect it silently, through dilution instead of direct seizure.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! The ultimate insider trading scheme, perfectly legal, completely devastating.

**Wake up, colonies. Your purchasing power didn't disappear—it was transferred.**
