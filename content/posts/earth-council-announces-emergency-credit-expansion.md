# The Emergency That Never Ends

The Earth Unified Council announced yesterday what they're calling an "emergency" 47 trillion SGC liquidity injection through the Galactic Central Bank. This marks the fifteenth "emergency" expansion in three years.

Councilor Patricia Vance held a brief transmission from Luna Station, explaining that "unprecedented galactic economic pressures" require "immediate and decisive action to maintain stability."

That's not an answer. Try again.

What Vance didn't mention: her own committee approved identical language for the last fourteen injections. Word for word. Same "unprecedented pressures." Same "immediate action." Same promises about "maintaining stability" while systematically destroying it.

I pulled the transcripts. In 2932, Vance called credit expansion "a temporary measure to address short-term liquidity concerns." In 2933, it became "necessary stimulus for economic recovery." By 2934, it was "essential infrastructure for interstellar commerce."

Now it's just "emergency policy." No explanation needed.

The GCB's own data shows what this "stability" actually produces: Credit dilution hit 23% last quarter. Food synthesizer costs on Frontier Settlements increased 40% in six months. Basic housing modules that cost 2,000 SGC in 2930 now run 8,500 SGC.

But the Ceres Exchange keeps climbing. Stellar Financial posted record profits. Orion Trust executives received bonuses totaling 2.3 billion SGC - more than the entire GDP of the Vega Colony cluster.

Coincidence? The data suggests otherwise.

Every credit created dilutes existing savings. Every "emergency" injection transfers purchasing power from workers to whoever receives the new credits first. This isn't economic theory - it's mathematical certainty.

Vance knows this. She signed the GCB audit reports. She attended the closed sessions where they discussed "wealth transfer mechanisms" and "managed inequality protocols." The minutes are public record - I've read them.

When asked directly about the audit findings, Vance's office responded: "The Councilor's position reflects current policy priorities and interstellar economic realities."

That's not an answer either.

Here's reality: The Earth Council has printed 340 trillion SGC since 2930. They've funded seventeen "temporary" programs that never ended, subsidized forty-three "strategic industries" that can't survive without handouts, and bailed out every major financial institution at least twice.

The cost? Savings destroyed. Retirement accounts worthless. Frontier families choosing between medication and food while Ceres traders buy their third orbital yacht.

Vance called this "necessary sacrifice for galactic prosperity."

I call it theft with a press release.

The next "emergency" expansion is scheduled for next quarter. Same script, same beneficiaries, same victims. The only thing changing is the size of the numbers.

And they wonder why trust in Earth institutions keeps collapsing faster than a failed warp core.
