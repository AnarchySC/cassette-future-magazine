Alright, let me break this down for you.

The Galactic Central Bank announced yesterday what they're calling a "modest adjustment" to the prime lending rate. HERE'S the beautiful part—they raised rates by 75 basis points while simultaneously announcing a new "liquidity facility" for Earth-based financial institutions.

You see what they did there?

## 信用収縮の実態

They're tightening credit for the outer colonies while printing fresh credits for their friends on Earth. The Cantillon Effect strikes again, baby.

Let me draw this out. When new money enters the system, who touches it first? The mega-corps with headquarters in the Tokyo-Angeles Megaplex. By the time that liquidity reaches Kepler-442b, it's already been diluted by three rounds of lending.

## What This Means For Colony Settlements

The Frontier Commerce Association released numbers this morning showing average borrowing costs for colonial enterprises have jumped 340 basis points since the start of the cycle. Meanwhile, Earth-based competitors are accessing the new liquidity facility at preferential rates.

This isn't complicated. It was made to seem complicated.

The official statement talks about "price stability across all systems." Check your grocery bill on any station past the asteroid belt. Then check one on Luna. I'll wait.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect in action. Now watch what happens next...
