# The Rise of Outer Rim Coalition Memory Manufacturing

*自作製造権の未来を左右する戦い* (The Battle That Will Decide the Future of DIY Manufacturing Rights)

I've been building memory cores in my lab for months now, watching the Outer Rim Coalition's quantum-state DRAM slowly push into markets the Core Systems thought they owned forever. And honestly? It's fascinating.

The Core Systems' response has been predictably territorial. Stellar Financial just released a report calling Outer Rim memory "potentially unreliable" - which is code for "cheaper than ours." Orion Trust followed up with warnings about "supply chain security" that read like they were dictated by their own fabrication subsidiaries.

Here's what they're not telling you: I've stress-tested ORC quantum cores against Core Systems equivalents for six months. Same read/write speeds. Same error correction. Sometimes better power efficiency. The only difference? Price point and patent restrictions.

The interesting part isn't that ORC manufacturing works - it's *why* it works so well. They open-sourced their quantum-state stabilization algorithms three years ago. Every fabricator in the Coalition can improve on the base design. Meanwhile, Core Systems manufacturers are still encrypting their error correction protocols and wonder why innovation stagnates.

"They patented *math*," one ORC engineer told me during a station tour. "Mathematical constants that exist in nature. Think about that."

The Core Systems built their memory monopoly on artificial scarcity - restricting fabrication licenses, hoarding quantum-state research, making replacement cores cost more than new systems. Now they're discovering what happens when someone ignores those arbitrary barriers.

What fascinates me most is watching real-time market disruption. Small-scale fabricators are already switching to ORC designs because they can actually modify them. Colony stations are building their own memory fabs instead of shipping orders across the solar system. The distributed manufacturing model is working exactly like the theorists predicted.

Here's how you can try this yourself: ORC published their full fabrication specs on the System-net last month. Basic quantum memory cores require standard molecular assemblers and materials most colony stations already stock. I've uploaded my testing methodology to the usual repositories - same stress tests, same benchmarks I use for Core Systems hardware.

The Defense Compact is already investigating "strategic technology transfers" - which translates to "how dare they make memory cores we can't control." But you can't uninvent shared knowledge. The fabrication protocols are distributed across thousands of stations now.

Stellar Financial's stock dropped twelve percent this quarter. Orion Trust is "reevaluating their memory division strategy." Translation: they're discovering that hoarding research only works when nobody else can do the research.

I don't understand why this surprises anyone. Knowledge shared multiplies. Knowledge hoarded dies with the hoarder. The Outer Rim Coalition just proved it on a galactic scale.

The Core Systems will adapt eventually - they'll have to. But watching a thousand-year monopoly crumble because someone decided to share quantum-state algorithms for free? That's beautiful. That's how progress actually works when you stop artificially constraining it.

*Full fabrication specs and my testing data available in the usual repositories. As always, build it yourself first - that's how you really understand it.*
