# The Numbers Don't Lie

Last cycle's neural processor recovery? Dead in the void. What looked like a return to reasonable pricing has reversed course faster than a mining ship dodging asteroids.

The Stellar Processing Guild's latest market data shows consumer neural processors jumping 40-60% since the AI datacenter rush began. Memory substrate costs spiked alongside this - turns out when you're building planet-sized thinking machines, individual users become an afterthought.

## Here's How You Can Track This Yourself

I've been monitoring wholesale prices through three independent suppliers across the Core Systems. The pattern is consistent: anything consumer-grade gets deprioritized the moment Orion Industries or Vega Corp places a bulk order for their latest "autonomous decision matrix."

The interesting part isn't that prices went up - it's *why* manufacturers think this makes sense long-term. You're alienating the entire individual market to chase quarterly datacenter contracts.

## Who Gets Hurt

Budget builders, as always. The RTX-9090 equivalent sees the smallest markup because wealthy enthusiasts will pay anything. But entry-level neural cores? Those jumped 70%. 

It's the same story we've seen with substrate fabrication, quantum memory, even basic calculation matrices. Prioritize the big contracts, squeeze individual users until they can barely afford last-generation hardware.

## The Real Problem

They patented *basic neural architecture*. Think about that. Core processing algorithms that should be mathematical foundations are locked behind licensing fees. No wonder prices stay artificially high - competition can't even enter the market without paying tribute to existing manufacturers.

I don't understand why we accept this. When I build test rigs for the lab, I have to source components from three different suppliers just to avoid patent restrictions on *how electrons flow through circuits*.

## What's Next

The Galactic Trade Commission says they're "monitoring the situation." Meanwhile, Stellar Processing Guild members are posting record profits while claiming supply constraints.

Here's my prediction: prices stay inflated until the datacenter boom peaks, then manufacturers will act surprised when consumer demand has shifted to open-source alternatives.

*Full component pricing methodology and supplier contacts available at the usual frequencies. Because if you can't verify the data, what's the point?*
