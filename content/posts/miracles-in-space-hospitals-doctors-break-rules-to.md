# 宇宙病院での奇跡：医師たちが規則を破って患者を救う
*Miracles in Space Hospitals: Doctors Break Rules to Save Patients*

## ケレス医療センターで見た、本当の治療とは何か

Dr. Elena Vasquez poured synthetic coffee while she explained how they really keep people alive out here.

"The Galactic Health Authority sends us protocols," she said, gesturing at the stack of unread directives on her desk. "Forty-seven forms for a broken arm. But when someone's dying, we just... figure it out."

I spent three weeks on Ceres Medical Station watching what actually happens when people get sick 200 million kilometers from Earth. The official org chart shows a strict hierarchy: Chief Administrator, Department Heads, Senior Staff. I asked who's in charge of the night shift. They looked at me strangely.

"Whoever needs to be," said Nurse Tanaka. "Last month, our 'Junior' medic Chen performed emergency surgery because she was the only one with steady hands during a solar storm. The forms said she wasn't qualified. The patient lived."

The real medical system runs on handwritten notes passed between shifts. Doctors sharing equipment without requisition orders. Maintenance techs who learned basic trauma care "just in case." They figured it out together. Nobody told them to.

In the pediatric ward, I watched Dr. Okonkwo treat a colony kid with a rare genetic condition. The approved treatment cost 50,000 SGC and required shipping specialized nanobots from Mars—a six-month wait. Instead, she modified existing stem cell therapy with equipment "borrowed" from the research lab.

"Back home, we'd just treat the patient," she said quietly. "Here, I'm supposed to fill out Impact Assessment Forms first. While children suffer."

The breakthrough came when I realized what I wasn't seeing: competition. No doctors hoarding knowledge or protecting territory. No nurses refusing to cross department lines. When the artificial gravity failed in Ward C, everyone—surgeons, janitors, administrators—grabbed whatever they could carry and moved patients to safety.

This is what it actually looks like when people who chose healing get to heal.

The GHA's new "Efficiency Protocol" arrives next month, promising to streamline care with AI-assisted triage and standardized response matrices. Dr. Vasquez showed me the 200-page implementation manual.

"It tells us exactly who can make which decisions when," she said. "Very organized. Very clear chain of command."

I asked what would happen if someone was dying and the proper authority wasn't available.

She smiled and poured more coffee. "We'll probably just save them anyway. That's what neighbors do."
