# Gold Rush 2935: Standard Galactic Credit Collapses

The Standard Galactic Credit dropped 23% against rare earth elements this week. That's not volatility—that's collapse.

Galactic Central Bank Chairman Kepler dismissed concerns in yesterday's neural-cast: "Credit dilution remains within acceptable parameters." Acceptable to whom? Not to the miners on Asteroid Belt Station 7 whose wages buy half the oxygen they bought last month.

Here's what the GCB won't tell you: they've diluted the credit supply by 400% since 2933. Physics doesn't negotiate with bureaucrats. When you create credits without creating value, purchasing power dies. Cause and effect.

"Temporary market adjustments," Kepler called it. I called his office. "That's not an answer. Try again."

Platinum hit 50,000 SGC per ounce. Gold breached 75,000. These aren't bubbles—they're lifeboats. When currency becomes confetti, people flee to reality.

## Neural-Net Under Corporate Control

Meanwhile, Earth's primary neural-feed platforms now operate under "emergency management" by Titan Communications Corp. Translation: corporate occupation.

Terran Intelligence Bureau Director Sarah Chen claims this protects against "dangerous misinformation." Dangerous to whom? Last week, investigative transmissions exposing Colony Security Force brutality got flagged as "harmful content." Truth is harmful when you're the one causing harm.

I don't deal in intentions. I deal in actions. The action here is censorship.

## Colony Security's War on Civilians

Speaking of brutality: Colony Security Forces raided three residential stations in the Outer Rim this week. Official reason? "Immigration enforcement." 

They arrested 400 civilians, including 67 children. Some had proper documentation. Didn't matter. When your operating principle is force, paperwork becomes optional.

Earth Unified Council Speaker Martinez called it "maintaining order." I've seen the footage. That's not order—that's terror.

Both major political factions supported the raids. The Unity Party praised "strong enforcement." The Progress Coalition demanded "humane enforcement." Same violence, different adjectives.

Contradictions don't exist. Check your premises. If both parties support the same policy, there's only one party.

## The Pattern

Connect these stories:
- Currency collapse drives citizens toward alternatives
- Information control eliminates criticism
- State violence suppresses resistance

This isn't coincidence. It's coordination.

When I worked for these people, I wrote speeches about "maintaining stability during transitions." I ghostwrote the lies they're living now.

The transition isn't toward stability. It's toward control.

Gold doesn't lie. Silver doesn't compromise. Platinum doesn't negotiate. Maybe that's why they're the only things holding value while everything else burns.

Next week, I'll be interviewing miners who've stopped accepting Standard Credits entirely. They deal in metal now—honest money for honest work.

That's journalism. No premises to check. Just reality, one atom at a time.
