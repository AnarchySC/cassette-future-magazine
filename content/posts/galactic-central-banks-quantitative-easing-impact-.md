# The Great Credit Expansion of 2935

Alright, let me break this down for you—the Galactic Central Bank just announced another round of "quantitative easing" to "stimulate interstellar commerce." They're printing 500 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits and pumping them into the system.

Sounds great for everyone, right? Wrong.

## HERE'S the beautiful part—

Those credits don't magically appear in every citizen's account simultaneously. Oh no. They follow a very specific path:

**First stop:** Mega-corps like Stellar Financial and Orion Trust get the fresh credits as "liquidity support"

**Second stop:** Core System governments receive "infrastructure funding"

**Third stop:** Major mining operations and shipping cartels get "expansion loans"

**Last stop (maybe):** Frontier colonies see some trickle-down benefits... eventually... if they're lucky

Now watch what happens next...

## The Cantillon Effect Goes Galactic

By the time those new credits reach the outer rim settlements, prices have already adjusted. The mega-corps got to spend their fresh money at yesterday's prices. Meanwhile, colonists on Proxima Station are paying 15% more for basic supplies before their wages catch up.

You see what they did there? It's wealth redistribution—from the periphery to the center. From the workers to the financiers. From the colonies to the Core Systems.

## This Week's Winner: Ceres Commodity Exchange

Ceres Exchange hit record highs as institutional investors deployed their fresh liquidity. Helium-3 futures, rare earth mining stocks, interstellar shipping—everything's pumping.

This Week's Loser: Everyone else.

## The Part They Don't Want You to Understand

The GCB claims this will "boost employment" and "increase trade velocity." But here's what really happens:

- **Asset inflation:** Ships, stations, and mining rights become more expensive
- **Currency debasement:** Your savings lose purchasing power
- **Wealth concentration:** Those closest to the money printer get richer

It's not a bug—it's a feature. The system works exactly as designed.

## The Real Question

Why does the GCB have this power? Why can a small group of technocrats in the Core Systems decide the purchasing power of credits held by miners on Titan or farmers on New Eden?

Because we let them.

Every time they promise "economic stability" while debasing our currency, we nod along. Every time they bail out connected mega-corps while small colony businesses fail, we accept it as "necessary."

Sound money isn't complicated. It's just inconvenient for those who benefit from the current system.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! Playing out across the galaxy, one credit expansion at a time.
