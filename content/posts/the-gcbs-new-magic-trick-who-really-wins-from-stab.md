# The GCB's Latest Sleight of Hand

Alright, let me break this down because the Galactic Central Bank just pulled their favorite trick again, and I'm watching traders on Ceres Exchange celebrate while regular colonists wonder why their grocery bills keep climbing.

Yesterday's 'emergency stabilization measure' - that's bureaucrat-speak for 'we're printing more credits' - injects 2.4 trillion fresh SGCs into the system. But here's the beautiful part they don't mention in the Earth Network News coverage: **where those credits land first**.

## Follow the Credit Flow

HERE'S the whiteboard moment - imagine I'm drawing this out:

**Step 1:** GCB creates 2.4 trillion new credits digitally (cost to them: literally zero)

**Step 2:** They buy government bonds from Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, and the other mega-corps

**Step 3:** These institutions now have fresh credits to lend at current prices

**Step 4:** By the time this new money trickles down to frontier settlements, prices have already started rising

You see what they did there? The mega-corps get to spend the new credits at yesterday's prices, while you get to buy groceries at tomorrow's inflated costs.

## The Cantillon Effect in Action

This is the part they really don't want you to understand - monetary expansion doesn't affect everyone equally. It's not like they drop credits from orbit uniformly across all colonies.

The closest you are to the money printer, the more you benefit. The furthest you are, the more you get screwed.

Now watch what happens next: Stellar Financial will use those fresh credits to buy up real assets - mining operations, shipping routes, agricultural stations. They're converting their early access to new money into things that hold value.

Meanwhile, your wages stay the same while your rent goes up.

## The 'Stability' Scam

The GCB claims this prevents 'deflationary spiral' in the outer rim settlements. But here's what's actually happening:

- **Mega-corp debt:** Gets inflated away (they borrowed yesterday's credits, paying back with today's cheaper ones)
- **Your savings:** Lose purchasing power every cycle
- **Asset prices:** Skyrocket as institutions buy real stuff with fake money
- **Income inequality:** Widens as connected insiders get richer

This isn't economic policy - it's wealth transfer with extra steps.

## Why They Keep Getting Away With It

The genius of this system is complexity. They've made monetary policy so boring and technical that most people's eyes glaze over. But strip away the jargon and it's simple:

**They print money. Their friends get it first. You pay for it through inflation.**

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

The next time some GCB official talks about 'maintaining price stability,' remember: they're not talking about keeping your costs stable. They're talking about keeping their game stable.

*Want to protect yourself? Convert SGCs to real assets before the next 'emergency measure.' Because there's always a next one.*
