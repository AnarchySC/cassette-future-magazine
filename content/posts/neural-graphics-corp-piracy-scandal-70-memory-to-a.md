# Neural Graphics Corp's Research Ethics Problem

Here's something that should concern anyone who cares about open knowledge: Neural Graphics Corp apparently used Aria's Archive - that shadow library of "liberated" research papers - to train their latest language models. They patented *math*. Think about that.

The interesting part isn't that they did it - it's that they're calling researchers who share knowledge "pirates" while simultaneously raiding those same archives. I don't understand the question. Why wouldn't research be freely available?

## Memory Monopoly Incoming

By 2936, analysts predict 70% of high-end quantum memory production will go to AI datacenters. That's leaving research labs, universities, and independent developers fighting over scraps. When I need memory arrays for wave-propagation experiments, I'm competing with mega-corps who can outbid entire colony administrations.

Here's how you can try this yourself: check current memory prices against last cycle's rates. The pattern is clear - artificial scarcity driving prices while actual innovation stagnates.

## The 2500W Problem

MSI's Lightning 5090 prototype reportedly pulls 2500 watts for extreme overclocking. That's enough to power my entire public lab for a day. Watching corps burn through energy for marginal performance gains while frontier settlements ration power feels spiritually bankrupt.

I built a comparable processing array using distributed nodes at 300W total. The schematics are in our public repository - feel free to iterate.

## N1 ARM Rumors Persist

Neural Graphics' rumored N1 ARM processor keeps surfacing in supply chain leaks. If true, it represents their push into the CPU market, presumably to create more vertically integrated AI systems. The concerning part: their track record suggests this will be locked down tighter than a corp vault.

Meanwhile, there's a fascinating "PXBOX 5" mod circulating the maker communities - someone retrofitted classic gaming hardware with modern neural processing cores. The documentation is beautifully open-source. This is what innovation looks like when knowledge flows freely.

## The Real Story

The pattern is clear: corps like Neural Graphics want exclusive access to research archives while criminalizing the sharing that created those archives. They're monetizing collective knowledge while calling the original sharers "pirates."

Knowledge hoarded is knowledge dead. Every encrypted research paper, every patented algorithm, every locked-down specification slows human progress. The researchers sharing through Aria's Archive aren't pirates - they're doing what science has always done: building on previous work.

I've posted our complete testing methodology for memory allocation efficiency in the appendix. Try it yourself. Compare corporate claims against measurable results. The numbers tell their own story.
