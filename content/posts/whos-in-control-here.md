# Who's In Control Here?

Worked construction on Station Kepler-442b back in '28. Foreman there had a saying: "Safety rules written in blood work. Safety rules written in fear just get people killed."

Been thinking about that watching the Interstellar Assembly debate their new neural-net "safety protocols." You know, the ones that'll monitor every transmission, flag "dangerous misinformation," and graciously protect us simple folk from ideas that might hurt our fragile minds.

Here's the thing about information control—it's never really about protecting you. It's about protecting someone else's position.

Remember when I was hauling ice between Ceres and Europa? Navigation data was considered "sensitive information" back then. Only licensed pilots could access the good stuff. Had to buy route data from approved vendors at premium prices. Made every run cost more, take longer, and frankly? Made space more dangerous.

Then some kid from the Outer Rim cracked the encryption. Published everything on an open neural feed. Navigation data, hazard reports, the works. The establishment screamed it would cause chaos. Ships would crash. Trade would collapse.

Know what actually happened? Shipping costs dropped 40%. Accident rates fell to record lows. Turned out when everyone has access to the same good information, everyone makes better decisions.

The real question is: why do our representatives in the Assembly get to decide what information is "safe" for the rest of us? Who elected them to be the galaxy's editors?

Look, I spent time in Naval intelligence. Clearance I don't talk about, situations you wouldn't believe. I understand operational security. But this isn't about protecting fleet movements or classified tech. This is about controlling public discourse.

Same rules for everyone. That's all any of us should be asking for. If misinformation is dangerous, then prove it wrong with better information. If an idea is harmful, counter it with a better idea. But don't tell me you need special authority to protect me from thoughts.

The haulers I worked with had another saying: "You can't steer a ship you can't see out of." These neural-net regulations? They're not installing better windows. They're boarding them up and asking us to trust their navigation.

That's not a bug in the system. That's the design.

Every dictator in history promised safety in exchange for freedom. Every oligarch offered protection in return for submission. The tools change. The game stays the same.

Your mind belongs to you. Your access to information belongs to you. Your right to make your own decisions—even wrong ones—belongs to you.

Anyone trying to take that away isn't protecting you. They're positioning themselves.

Who's trying to control who here? Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
