# Who's Controlling Who Here?

*The truth behind the new mining permit system*

Let me tell you about a conversation I had yesterday with a hauler named Torres. Twenty-three years pulling ice from the Belt, owns her own rig, three kids on Europa Station. Good people.

She's being forced out of business.

Not by competition. Not by market forces. By the Interstellar Assembly's shiny new "Unified Mining Safety Protocol"—a permit system so Byzantine it makes old Earth tax codes look like haiku.

Here's the thing about safety regulations: they're supposed to make things safer. This one doesn't. What it does is require a 47-step certification process that costs more than Torres makes in six months. Plus annual renewals. Plus "compliance inspections" from certified contractors who—surprise—all happen to be subsidiaries of Orion Mining Collective.

"They're not even pretending anymore," Torres told me, staring into her coffee like it held answers. "It's designed to kill the independents."

Look, I've been around. Built stations in hard vacuum where one mistake turns you into organic matter spread across a thousand klicks. I know what real safety looks like. It's simple rules, enforced consistently. Check your seals. Monitor your air. Don't cut corners on life support. Same rules for everyone.

This isn't that.

This is regulatory capture wearing a safety badge. The big corps write the rules, staff the compliance offices, and collect the fees. Meanwhile, independent miners who've been working the Belt since before half the Assembly was born get branded as "safety risks" and forced to sell their rigs to guess who?

The haulers know it. The miners know it. Hell, even some Assembly representatives know it—off the record, after a few drinks at station bars. But the credits keep flowing upward, so nobody with power to change things wants to rock the boat.

I've seen this movie before. Back during the crypto boom, when financial "reforms" somehow always ended up benefiting the same three mega-banks that helped write the legislation. Different century, same script.

The real question is: what are we going to do about it?

Torres has an answer. She's joining the Independent Haulers Collective—a loose network of operators who've decided to ignore the permits and work direct contracts with frontier settlements that need supplies more than they need Assembly approval.

"Let them try to shut down every independent in the Belt," she said. "We were here first, and we'll be here after their fancy permits are forgotten."

That's not a bug in the system. That's the feature we need more of.

Same rules for everyone means everyone gets to play. When the rules themselves become weapons, maybe it's time to question who's holding them.
