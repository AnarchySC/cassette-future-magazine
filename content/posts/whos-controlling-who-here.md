# Who's Controlling Who Here?

*The real cost of the new "safety" regulations*

Twenty years ago, I was pulling ice from the outer Belt in a retrofitted mining tender held together with prayer and liquid metal patches. Ship computer older than my daughter's neural implants. Radiation shielding that wouldn't protect a lab mouse. And you know what? Never lost a cargo. Never lost a crew member.

Wasn't because I was lucky. Wasn't because I was reckless either. It was because when your life depends on your equipment, you maintain your equipment. When there's no rescue coming for six months, you think twice about cutting corners. The margins teach you respect.

Look, I get why the Interstellar Assembly thinks independent haulers need "enhanced safety protocols." Three accidents in the Vesta corridor this cycle. Forty-seven lives lost. Nobody wants to see good people die in the black.

But here's the thing about their new regulations—they're not written by people who've ever sealed a hull breach with their bare hands. They're written by committee members who've never been more than a day's flight from the nearest rescue beacon.

Mandatory ship inspections every six months? Sounds reasonable until you realize the nearest certified inspector is three weeks out from most hauler routes. New atmospheric processors for ships over fifteen years old? That's half the independent fleet right there. And don't get me started on the "crew certification requirements"—as if twenty years of not dying isn't certification enough.

The real question is: who benefits when small operators can't afford compliance?

Mega-corps like Stellar Freight are already praising the new rules. Amazing coincidence. They've got inspection facilities at every major hub. They've got the capital to retrofit entire fleets overnight. They've got lawyers who helped write the regulations.

Meanwhile, the indie hauler who's been running clean for decades suddenly can't afford to operate. Has to sell his route to... guess who?

That's not a bug. That's the design.

I've seen this play before. Back in the old Solar Authority days, they "reformed" the mining codes. Cleaned up the dangerous practices, they said. Made everything safer. Except somehow all the safety requirements happened to match exactly what the big mining consortiums were already doing. Funny how that works.

Same rules for everyone would mean the mega-corps follow the same maintenance schedules as the indies. Use the same equipment standards. Face the same penalties for cutting corners. But they don't, do they? Their "corporate safety programs" get them exemptions the little guy never sees.

Look, nobody's arguing against safety. We all want to come home. But real safety comes from skin in the game, not compliance paperwork. Real safety comes from people who know their ships because their lives depend on it.

The Assembly could have required better emergency beacons. Could have funded more rescue stations in the outer routes. Could have subsidized equipment upgrades instead of mandating them.

But that wouldn't have consolidated market share.

Who's trying to control who here? Follow the credits.
