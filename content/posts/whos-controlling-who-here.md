# Who's Controlling Who Here?

Back when I was hauling ice between Titan and the Belt, we had a saying: *If it floats, it boats.* Didn't matter if your ship was jury-rigged scrap or fresh from the Martian yards. If you could make runs without killing anybody, you belonged out there.

Turns out the Interstellar Assembly missed that memo.

Their shiny new Planet Verification System rolled out last month with all the fanfare of a military parade. "Ensuring galactic standards," they called it. "Protecting settlers from substandard worlds." Real noble stuff, if you ignore the part where Earth bureaucrats now decide which colonies get to call themselves "legitimate."

Here's the thing about legitimacy—it used to come from whether people could actually live somewhere. Breathable air, decent soil, manageable radiation. Basic stuff. Now it comes from filing Form 2847-C and waiting eighteen months for some desk jockey who's never left Low Earth Orbit to stamp your paperwork.

I talked to Kenji Nakamura last week. Guy spent fifteen years turning a dead rock in the Proxima system into something that grows actual food. Feeds twelve thousand people. But his colony doesn't have "proper atmospheric monitoring stations" according to the new standards, so Earth won't recognize them. Can't get banking. Can't get supply contracts. Can't even get their births registered.

"Same rules for everyone," Earth says. Except the rules were written by people who never had to choose between buying air scrubbers or keeping the fusion reactor running.

Look, I'm not against standards. When I was in construction, we followed safety protocols because nobody wanted to explain to someone's family why the habitat breach happened. But those were protocols written by people who'd actually built habitats. By people who understood the trade-offs.

This verification system? It's written by committee. By people whose biggest risk is their morning coffee being too cold.

The real question is why we're letting them decide. These colonies didn't ask Earth for permission when they launched. They didn't ask for permission when they figured out how to turn rocks into farms. Why are they asking now?

Every verification requirement, every compliance fee, every mandatory inspection—it's not about safety. It's about control. It's about making sure every world in human space knows who's really in charge.

That's not a bug. That's the design.

Out in the Belt, we learned something Earth forgot: people don't need permission to be free. They need permission to be controlled. The difference matters.

So next time someone tells you the new standards are for your own protection, ask them who decided you needed protecting. Ask them who benefits when legitimate colonies get labeled "unauthorized settlements."

Ask them who's trying to control who here.

Because the answer isn't what they're selling.
