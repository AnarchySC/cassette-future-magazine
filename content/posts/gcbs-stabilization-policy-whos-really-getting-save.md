# The Beautiful Scam They Call 'Stabilization'

Alright, let me break this down for you because what the GCB announced yesterday is economic theater at its finest.

Chairman Nakamura stood at that podium talking about "ensuring interstellar trade stability" and "protecting frontier economies" - but HERE'S the beautiful part: look at who gets the newly created Standard Galactic Credits first.

## The Cantillon Express Lane

You see what they did there? They announced 2.4 trillion SGC in "emergency liquidity" - but watch the flow:

**FIRST STOP**: Primary dealers like Stellar Financial and Orion Trust get wholesale access at 0.25% rates

**SECOND STOP**: These mega-corps immediately park it in Ceres Exchange derivatives and colony real estate

**LAST STOP** (maybe): Frontier settlements see trickle-down effects... eventually... if they're lucky

This is the part they don't want you to understand - it's not about stability, it's about who gets to spend the new money BEFORE prices adjust.

## The Real Numbers Don't Lie

While Chairman Nakamura was promising to "support small colony businesses," check the actual allocation:
- 78% goes to "systemically important financial institutions"
- 15% for "interstellar infrastructure" (read: mega-corp shipping contracts)
- 7% for "direct colony assistance" (with 47 bureaucratic hoops to jump through)

Meanwhile, antimatter fuel prices on Kepler Station jumped 23% within HOURS of the announcement. Coincidence? 

Now watch what happens next - all that fresh liquidity chases the same assets while frontier settlements deal with inflated import costs. The mega-corps get asset appreciation, the colonies get credit dilution.

## The Setup They Won't Admit

Here's your whiteboard moment: The GCB creates this crisis-response cycle on purpose. Financial stress hits → print credits → bailout connected players → asset bubbles form → bubble pops → "emergency" response needed → repeat.

Every cycle, wealth concentrates upward while they sell it as "protecting the little guy."

The Outer Rim Coalition figured this out years ago - that's why they're building their own trade networks using energy-backed currencies. No wonder Earth Unified Council keeps finding reasons for "peacekeeping operations" out there.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! The closer you sit to the money printer, the richer you get. Everyone else pays through dilution.

## The Real Question

So next time you hear "stabilization policy," ask yourself: stable for WHO? Because I guarantee you, it's not for the colony miners dealing with 30% food price increases or the frontier farmers watching their savings evaporate.

The game is rigged, but at least now you can see the cards.
