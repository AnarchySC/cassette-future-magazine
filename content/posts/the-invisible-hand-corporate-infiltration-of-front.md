# The Invisible Hand: Corporate Infiltration of Frontier Developers

*An investigation into Centari Holdings' shadow operations in frontier entertainment markets*

Sixteen days. That's how long Stellar Guard Studios lasted after launching *Neural Vanguard*, their persistent-feed combat sim. 97,000 concurrent users on launch day, then straight into the recycler. Most staff terminated within the cycle. CEO Dusty Welch told reporters his studio was "pure frontier independent."

The manifest doesn't match the cargo.

Internal documents obtained through frontier data brokers reveal Centari Holdings—through subsidiary Timi Entertainment Networks—provided 78% of Stellar Guard's operating capital. That's one version of "independent."

Centari maintains stakes in over 600 entertainment ventures across seventeen sectors. Their support teams, sometimes numbering 1,000 personnel, deploy to "partner" studios with singular focus: convert creative ventures into persistent-revenue streams. When projects fail, Centari absorbs losses through subsidiary structure. Studios take public blame. Developers lose positions.

An anonymous Stellar Guard developer described "ghost protocol"—internal performance metrics designed to pressure studios toward self-destruction. "They'd show up quarterly with charts. User retention below threshold. Revenue projections missing targets. Always the same recommendation: pivot to persistent-feed architecture."

Free, they said. I checked the fine print.

Frontier development revenues grew 22% compound annually while inner-system AAA entertainment expanded only 8%. Of the twenty highest-rated sims in 2934, fifteen originated from actual frontier studios. Only 7% of users prioritize graphical fidelity, yet AAA productions spend hundreds of millions of credits on visual processing power.

The pattern repeats: BioWare Studios absorbed by Electronic Arts, then decline. Halo franchise transferred to 343 Industries, creative soul extracted. Remedy Entertainment partnered with Centari, immediately pivoted to persistent-feed architecture for *FBC Firebreak*. Fat Shark Gaming accepted Centari funding, watched *Darktide* hemorrhage 96% of active users.

After Centari's Stellar Guard involvement surfaced, entertainment journalists launched coordinated messaging: "This is standard industry practice." But Galactic Development Conference data shows 60% of frontier studios self-fund through personal savings. Crowd-funding platforms raised 26.1 million SGC in 2934 with 83% project success rates.

Real frontier studios don't need inner-system money.

Console entertainment concentration hit Herfindahl index 2,207 by 2931—officially "highly concentrated" market structure. Last cycle: 81 billion SGC in entertainment mergers. Four conglomerates control 82% of platform distribution. Fifteen of nineteen persistent-feed launches in 2934 lost 80-99% of active users within first quarter.

The conglomerates can't innovate—budgets too massive, risk tolerance too narrow. Solution: secretly fund frontier studios to access innovation they can't produce internally.

Centari SVP Steven Ma serves on Galactic Entertainment Awards advisory board. *Neural Vanguard* received world premiere slot—most valuable announcement position of the ceremony.

Nobody ever asks what it costs to enforce creative vision from seventeen light-years away.

Centari's frontier infiltration strategy operates through three phases: identify promising independent studios, provide "partnership" funding with minimal visible strings, then gradually shift development toward persistent-revenue models. When projects fail—as 78% do under this structure—Centari writes off losses while frontier communities lose jobs and creative infrastructure.

The real question isn't whether Centari manipulates frontier entertainment markets. Internal documents confirm systematic operations across forty-three systems. 

The question is: how many "independent" studios are actually Centari subsidiaries operating under false frontier credentials?
