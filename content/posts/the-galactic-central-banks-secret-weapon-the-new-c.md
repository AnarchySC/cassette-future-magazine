# The Galactic Central Bank's Secret Weapon: The New Cantillon Effect

*なぜあなたのクレジットが毎日価値を失っているのか*

Alright, let me break this down for you because what just happened this week is EXACTLY why I left trading to become a financial educator.

The Galactic Central Bank announced another "economic stimulus" - 847 trillion fresh Standard Galactic Credits pumped directly into the system. They're calling it the "Interstellar Recovery Initiative." Beautiful name, right? Makes you feel warm and fuzzy.

HERE'S the beautiful part - and this is the part they don't want you to understand.

## The 2935 Cantillon Effect: A Whiteboard Moment

Picture this: The GCB creates 847 trillion SGCs out of thin air. Not printed - created. Digital entries in the Distributed Processing Cores. Boom. Money exists.

Now watch what happens next...

**Step 1:** Those credits go FIRST to the mega-corps. Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, the usual suspects on Ceres Exchange. They get to spend this brand-new money while prices are still at yesterday's levels.

**Step 2:** These mega-corps buy up assets - mining rights on Europa, agricultural stations in the Outer Rim, residential pods on Mars colonies. They're shopping with tomorrow's money at today's prices.

**Step 3:** By the time those 847 trillion credits work their way down to your paycheck from Colony Administration or your fabrication shop, guess what? Prices have already adjusted upward.

You see what they did there? The connected players get the party invitations. Everyone else gets the hangover.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Since the GCB started this "quantitative enhancement" program:
- Basic food synthesizer pods: +340% 
- Housing units: +280%
- Transport fuel: +195%
- Your wages: +12%

This isn't inflation, friends. This is theft with extra steps.

## The Beautiful Scam

Here's why this system is absolutely genius from their perspective: They convinced everyone that credit dilution is GOOD for the economy. "Stimulus prevents deflation!" they cry. "We're saving jobs!"

But check this out - when you create money for connected insiders first, you're literally redistributing purchasing power from savers to speculators. From workers to Wall Street... sorry, Ceres Exchange.

And THAT'S the Cantillon Effect, baby! Named after an 18th-century economist who figured this out when Earth still had separate nations.

## What You Can Do

This is the part they REALLY don't want you to understand: Financial literacy is self-defense. 

Start asking questions:
- Why do the mega-corps get first access to new credits?
- Why is your fabrication-right repair shop struggling while Stellar Financial just bought another asteroid?
- Why does "economic stimulus" somehow make everything more expensive?

Sound money is a human right. The GCB's printer goes brrr, but your purchasing power doesn't have to disappear.

Stay tuned next week when we break down exactly which Colony Administrations are fighting back against the credit dilution racket. Spoiler alert: It's more than the Earth Network News wants you to know.

*Remember: Every time they "stimulate" the economy, somebody's getting stimulated. Make sure it's not just the usual suspects.*
