# Supply Chain Blues Hit Processing Market

The processing core market took another hit this cycle as availability dropped to historic lows. Quantum Tech's latest fabrication delays have pushed premium neural cores to 400% markup on secondary markets.

Here's what's actually happening: Fabric AI signed an exclusive supply deal with Quantum Tech three quarters ago. Now that AI model training demands have exploded across the colonies, other manufacturers can't get enough cores to meet demand. The Ceres Exchange shows processing power futures up 280% since the deal went public.

## Partnership Under Investigation

The Interstellar Trade Commission opened an inquiry into whether Fabric AI's supply agreement violates competition standards. Internal transmissions suggest Quantum Tech prioritized Fabric AI orders while standard customers faced 18-month delays.

"They cornered the market, then surprised nobody wanted to pay monopoly prices," said Dr. Chen Martinez from the Independent Hardware Collective. Martinez has been reverse-engineering Quantum Tech cores in her public lab. "The interesting part isn't that they did it - it's how obvious they were about it."

The IHC published complete fabrication specs for three core types last week. "I don't understand the question. Why wouldn't I share it?" Martinez responded when asked about potential patent issues.

## Code Quality Concerns

Meridian Corp's development team accused Stellar Dynamics of using AI-generated code for critical system drivers. The allegation surfaced after multiple colonies reported processing instabilities.

"Look at this driver code," transmitted lead engineer Yuki Tanaka. "It reads like someone fed our documentation to a language model and called it done. No human would write recursive functions this badly."

Stellar Dynamics denied the claims but couldn't explain why their latest driver updates contained comments in three different programming philosophies.

The real issue? When you can't get decent processing cores, you start cutting corners everywhere else. AI-generated code costs nothing but testing time. Manual coding costs engineer hours nobody has.

## What You Can Do

Here's how you can try this yourself: The IHC maintains public fabrication data for seven core architectures. Basic processing units take about 40 hours on standard colony equipment. More complex neural cores need specialized cleanrooms, but the plans are all open-source.

Martinez's lab streams their fabrication sessions on the neural-net. "The work matters, not the name," she says when asked about credit. "Anyone should be able to build what they need."

They patented *basic arithmetic functions*. Think about that.

Processing power shouldn't require permission slips from Quantum Tech. The mathematics haven't changed in 300 years - just who's allowed to use them.
