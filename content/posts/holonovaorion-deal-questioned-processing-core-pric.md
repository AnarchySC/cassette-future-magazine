# Partnership Under Pressure

The much-hyped collaboration between Orion Systems and HoloNova is hitting turbulence just months after announcement. Sources within both companies report "philosophical differences" about data sharing - though that's corporate-speak for "someone's hoarding the good stuff."

They patented *math*. Think about that. Basic neural architectures that should be freely available are now locked behind licensing agreements that would make a Ferengi blush.

# Processing Core Crisis Deepens

If you've been trying to build anything lately, you've felt it. Processing cores that cost 200 SGC last quarter are now pushing 800. The official line? "Supply chain disruptions in the Asteroid Belt." The reality? Artificial scarcity manufactured by the same companies crying shortage.

I built a basic processing array last month using open-source fabrication patterns. Total cost: 127 SGC. Same performance as the "premium" cores selling for five times that. Here's how you can try this yourself: [fabrication pattern attached]

The interesting part isn't that it works - it's *why* it works. These companies are charging premium prices for what's essentially commoditized technology. They're selling the brand, not the capability.

# Andromeda's AI Problem

The Galactic Fabrication Foundation dropped serious allegations this week: Andromeda Corp's latest system updates contain AI-generated code that "demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of quantum processing architecture."

Translation? They let their AI write code it didn't understand, then shipped it to millions of devices across the Core Systems.

I don't understand the question. Why wouldn't they test this properly? Why wouldn't they open-source the verification process? We're talking about infrastructure that powers entire stations.

# The Real Issue

All these stories connect to the same problem: knowledge hoarded is knowledge dead. When companies encrypt their research, patent basic mathematics, and hide their testing methodology, we all suffer.

Orion and HoloNova could revolutionize neural processing - if they'd share their breakthroughs instead of fighting over licensing. Processing cores could be affordable - if manufacturers published their fabrication specs. Andromeda's code could be reliable - if they'd let the community review it.

I've uploaded my complete testing setup to the public lab. Every measurement, every failure, every success. Because that's how science works. That's how we build things that actually function.

The corporations will figure this out eventually. Question is whether they'll do it before or after their customers build better alternatives themselves.
