# The Great Credit Expansion Scam of 2935

Alright, let me break this down for you step by step, because what the GCB announced yesterday is textbook monetary manipulation - and they're counting on you not understanding how it works.

## Here's What They're Telling You

The Galactic Central Bank is "injecting 50 trillion Standard Galactic Credits into frontier settlement economies" to "stimulate growth and provide relief to struggling colonies."

Sounds nice, right? They're helping the little guy!

## Now Watch What Actually Happens

Okay okay okay, here's the whiteboard moment. When the GCB creates 50 trillion new credits out of thin air - literally just updating numbers in their quantum ledger - who gets that money FIRST?

Not the struggling farmer on Kepler Station.
Not the small fabricator shop on Europa Colony.

It goes to:
- Stellar Financial Corporation
- Orion Trust Mega-Bank  
- Core Systems Infrastructure Inc.
- The big players with direct GCB lending relationships

THIS is the Cantillon Effect in action, people!

## The Beautiful Scam

HERE'S the beautiful part - by the time those fresh credits trickle down to frontier settlements, prices have already started rising. The mega-corps got to spend their new credits at yesterday's prices. The colonists? They get to buy necessities at tomorrow's inflated prices.

Let me draw this out:

**Hour 1:** GCB creates 50 trillion SGC  
**Hour 2:** Stellar Financial gets first access, buys rare earth mining rights at current prices  
**Day 30:** Credits reach colony banks  
**Day 90:** Frontier settlers notice everything costs more

You see what they did there? The people closest to the money printer get rich. Everyone else gets poorer through credit dilution.

## The Real Numbers

Here's what they don't want you to understand: Since 2930, the GCB has expanded the credit supply by 340%. Colony wages? Up 12%.

Do the math. The purchasing power of frontier settlements has been systematically destroyed while Core Systems wealth has exploded.

## The Exit Strategy

This is why sound money matters. When credits are backed by nothing but promises and quantum encryption, they can create infinite amounts. But they can't create infinite goods and services.

Every credit expansion is a wealth transfer from savers to borrowers, from the periphery to the center, from the future to the present.

And THAT'S why your ancestors switched to crypto-locked asteroid gold in the first place - until the GCB "temporarily" suspended convertibility during the Martian Crisis.

Temporary. Right.

## The Bottom Line

Next time you hear "liquidity injection" or "quantitative easing," just remember: it's not stimulus. It's theft with extra steps.

The house always wins, and you're not in the house.
