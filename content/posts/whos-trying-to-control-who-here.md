# Who's Trying to Control Who Here?

Back when I was hauling ice between Ceres and Europa, we had a saying: "If someone needs to know where you are every second of every day, they're either your mother or planning to rob you."

The Galactic Central Bank isn't anyone's mother.

Their new Vessel Identification Protocol sounds reasonable enough on the surface. Mandatory transponders on every ship over 10 tons. Real-time location tracking. "For safety," they say. "To prevent collisions." "To coordinate rescue operations."

Look, I've been in space long enough to know what prevents collisions: paying attention and following traffic lanes. I've also been in enough scrapes to know that when someone really needs rescue, they're already broadcasting their location as loud as they can.

But here's the thing about surveillance—it never stays focused on the original problem.

When I was running comm networks in the Belt, we had a client who wanted to track employee productivity. Just to "optimize workflows," they said. Within six months, they were using the same system to monitor bathroom breaks, lunch conversations, and who talked to competitors. Same rules for everyone became different rules for management and workers real fast.

The GCB says this is about safety. But buried in subsection 47-C of the protocol is language about "economic monitoring" and "tax compliance verification." Amazing how a collision-prevention system suddenly needs access to cargo manifests and financial records.

I remember my first supervisor on the construction crews around Saturn. Guy named Martinez. He taught me that the best way to spot a control freak is to watch what they do when you ask "why." Reasonable people explain. Controllers deflect.

So I asked my Assembly representative why the protocol needs real-time tracking instead of just emergency beacons. Why it needs cargo data for collision prevention. Why there's no opt-out for vessels operating in deep space where collisions are mathematically impossible.

Got a form letter about "comprehensive safety measures" and "interstellar commerce standards."

The real question is: who benefits from knowing where every independent hauler, trader, and prospector is at all times? Not the haulers. We already know where we are. Not legitimate shippers. They're already tracked through port authorities.

No, this benefits the same people who always benefit from surveillance: those who make money by controlling others.

There's a reason the mega-corps support this protocol while independent operators oppose it. When Stellar Financial can track every competitor's route and cargo, guess who gets the better shipping contracts?

Here's what I learned selling comm equipment: the customer who insists they need to monitor everything usually has the least legitimate reason for the information.

Same rules for everyone means the GCB follows the same privacy standards they're imposing on us. Let them broadcast their meeting locations, transaction records, and travel itineraries in real-time. For safety, of course.

Until then, maybe we should ask who's really trying to control who here.
