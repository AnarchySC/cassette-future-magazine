# Who's Trying to Control Who Here?

*The truth behind the new "safety" regulations*

Back when I was hauling ice between Ceres and Vesta, there was this guy—let's call him Marcus—who'd show up at independent mining claims with a clipboard and a very serious expression. "New safety requirements," he'd say. "Gotta protect the workers." 

Funny thing about Marcus: he always worked for whichever mega-corp was trying to buy out that particular claim. And somehow, these "safety requirements" always cost exactly what most independents couldn't afford.

The Galactic Central Bank's new "Autonomous Mining Safety Protocols" remind me a lot of Marcus.

Here's the thing about safety—real safety comes from people who actually do the work having the authority to make decisions about how they do it. When someone who's never been inside a mining suit starts writing regulations about EVA procedures, you're not getting safety. You're getting control.

Look at what these protocols actually require: "Certified oversight personnel" for any operation with more than three workers. "Standardized equipment verification" through GCB-approved testing facilities—located conveniently on Earth and Mars, nowhere near the Belt where the work actually happens. "Regular compliance audits" that somehow cost more than most small operations gross in a standard cycle.

That's not a bug. That's the design.

I spent two decades in space construction. You know what kept us safe? Experienced crews who knew their equipment, understood the risks, and had the freedom to say "this isn't right" without worrying about some bureaucrat's checklist. The most dangerous jobs I ever worked were the ones where Earth-side "experts" had written procedures for situations they'd never actually faced.

The real question is: who benefits when independent miners can't afford to operate anymore? 

Spoiler alert: it's not the miners. It's not even the consumers paying inflated prices for processed materials. It's the same mega-corps that have been trying to eliminate independent competition for centuries—the ones that coincidentally have the resources to comply with expensive new regulations.

Same rules for everyone? That would mean the regulations applied equally to Stellar Mining Consortium and a three-person family operation on Pallas. But somehow, when you can afford to keep a compliance department on payroll, these "burdensome" regulations become just another cost of doing business.

Here's what I learned selling comm networks in the Belt: the moment someone starts talking about "protecting you for your own good," check your wallet. Then check who's standing behind them, and what they stand to gain.

Independent miners built this system. They took the risks, developed the techniques, figured out how to extract resources from rocks spinning in the dark. Now that the infrastructure exists, suddenly we need "oversight" from people who've never strapped on a suit.

I'm not against safety. I'm against safety theater designed to eliminate competition. There's a difference, and anyone who's actually done the work knows it.

Same rules for everyone—including the people making the rules.
