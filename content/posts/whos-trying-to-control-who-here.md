# Who's Trying To Control Who Here?

Back when I was hauling ice between Ceres and Europa, we had a saying: "Trust your instruments, but check them twice." Made sense when a faulty reading could leave you drifting in the black with no way home.

Now the Interstellar Assembly wants to be our instruments. Their new Neural-Net Safety Protocol promises to filter "dangerous misinformation" from our feeds before it reaches our cortex implants. For our own good, naturally.

Here's the thing about information control—it's never really about the information.

I remember my first week in Naval intelligence. Commander showed me two reports about the same pirate raid in the Vega sector. One called them "freedom fighters resisting colonial oppression." The other labeled them "terrorists threatening civilian shipping." Same facts. Same dead haulers floating in vacuum. Different story.

"Which one's true?" I asked.

"Both," she said. "And neither. Truth isn't the point. Control is."

Look, I've seen actual misinformation kill people. Bad navigation data, faulty reactor specs, doctored medical files. But those weren't problems because someone shared them on neural-feed. They were problems because someone with authority decided lies served their purpose better than truth.

The Assembly's new protocol creates a Ministry of Truth staffed by the same politicians who told us the Martian water shortage was "temporary" while they were selling extraction rights to Titan Corp. These are the people who want to decide what information is safe for your brain?

Same rules for everyone—that's what I told my daughter when she was learning to pilot. If something's dangerous enough to ban, ban it for everybody. Including the people doing the banning. But somehow I doubt Assembly members will be running their private communications through the same filters they're mandating for us.

The real question is: what are they so afraid we'll learn?

When I was selling comm networks in the Belt, the best customers were the ones who asked the hardest questions. They understood that information is like atmosphere—you need free circulation or everything starts to die.

Trust your instruments, sure. But when someone else wants to calibrate them for you, check twice who benefits from the readings you're getting.

That's not a bug in the system. That's the design.
