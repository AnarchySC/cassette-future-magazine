# The Cosmic Scam of Quantitative Easing
## Why the Galactic Central Bank Never Stops Printing

Alright, let me break this down—because what the GCB announced yesterday isn't 'economic stimulus.' It's the oldest wealth transfer scheme in the galaxy, and they're doing it right in front of your face.

**Here's the whiteboard moment:**

The Galactic Central Bank creates 2.8 trillion new Standard Galactic Credits out of thin digital air. Not backed by asteroid mining, not backed by productivity gains from the rim colonies. Just *created*. 

Now watch what happens next...

First: Those fresh SGCs go straight to Stellar Financial, Orion Trust, and the other mega-corps on Ceres Exchange. Not to you. Not to the frontier settlements struggling with supply chain disruptions. To the institutions that are already swimming in liquidity.

Second: These mega-corps use this free money to buy up productive assets—mining operations, terraforming equipment, transport vessels. Real stuff that generates real value.

Third: You wake up six cycles later wondering why your rent on Mars Station went up 40% and why that plasma torch you've been saving for costs twice as many credits.

THIS is the Cantillon Effect in action, and it's the most elegant wealth redistribution scheme ever devised.

You see what they did there? The people closest to the money printer get rich buying assets with cheap credits. Everyone else gets crushed by the resulting credit dilution that hits consumer goods months later.

**The Beautiful Part** (and by beautiful I mean absolutely diabolical):

The GCB calls this 'supporting interstellar commerce' while systematically making productive work worthless. A colonist mining titanium on Europa puts in 12-hour shifts, creates actual value, and gets paid in credits that buy less every cycle. Meanwhile, Stellar Financial's algorithms extract profit from the spread between fresh money and diluted purchasing power.

Here's what they don't want you to understand: This isn't a bug in the system. This IS the system.

Every 'emergency liquidity measure' is a planned transfer of wealth from workers to asset holders. Every 'crisis' that demands money printing somehow benefits the same inner circle of Ceres Exchange mega-corps.

And THAT'S why sound money isn't just an economic preference—it's a human right. When they can create purchasing power from nothing, they can steal your labor without you even noticing.

The frontier settlements are catching on, though. Some outer rim colonies have started backing their local exchange credits with rare earth deposits. Making their own rules. The GCB calls this 'dangerous monetary experimentation.'

I call it self-defense.
