# Lex'ani Reilly

*Meet Lexani Reilly, the 456-year-old Felinari firecracker who has got those hypnotic slit pupils and enough attitude to power a dreadnought! When she is not chasing down cosmic anomalies in her tricked-out station hopper The Lucky Dream, this No Law Zone 7 native is either organizing union strikes, throwing down serious credits at high-stakes tables, or mapping systems that do not officially exist. Fair warning: this cat has got claws, and she is not afraid to use them whether she is negotiating worker contracts or navigating uncharted space!*
