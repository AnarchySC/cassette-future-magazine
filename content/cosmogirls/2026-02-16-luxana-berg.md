# Lux'ana Berg

*Meet Lux'ana Berg, the galaxy's most adorable artifact hunter who's as deadly as she is fluffy! This 25-year-old Vulpari vixen cruises the cosmos in her sleek Strike craft "The Neon Star," appraising ancient alien treasures by day and penning mysterious love letters by night. When she's not busy cult-hopping or dominating retro arcade games at her home base (the infamous Last Resort Clinic), Lux is perfecting her hit-and-run tactics—because sometimes the best deals require a quick getaway!*
