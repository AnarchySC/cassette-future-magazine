# Lex'ani 'Dream' Sorensen

*Meet Lex'ani "Dream" Sorensen, the 22-year-old Symbian bombshell who's trading comet dust for domestic bliss aboard her trusty ride, The Silver Lady—a long-range transport that's older than her great-grandmother but runs like a dream thanks to those bulletproof CRT nav systems. When she's not penning mysterious love letters or shape-shifting for kicks, this LV-426 colony girl can be found chasing stellar phenomena across the outer rim, proving that even aspiring trad-wives need a little adventure in their lives. With 110 Symbian years of wisdom packed into her youthful frame, Dream's the perfect blend of old-school reliability and cosmic wanderlust.*
