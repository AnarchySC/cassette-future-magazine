# Sex'ani 'Ion' Orlov

*Meet Sex'ani 'Ion' Orlov, the 41-year-old purple-skinned Vexian who keeps the galaxy's rides running smooth as her callsign from her floating garage, The Dark Kiss. When this golden-eyed gravity tech isn't fine-tuning some hotshot pilot's rig in the void, you'll catch her ringside at the deadliest arena matches in three sectors or bending spacetime for the ultimate vacation high. This Sanctuary Moon native proves that the best gear heads don't just wrench on machines—they live life in the fast lane, whether that's speedrunning virtual worlds or literally slowing down time to savor the ride.*
