# Sel'ene Fernandez

*Meet Sel'ene Fernandez, the purple-skinned speed demon who calls Titan Fuel Depot home and turns heads faster than her illegally-modded racing shuttle, The Midnight Star. When this 26-year-old Vexian hologram projectionist isn't lighting up the void with her golden eyes and stripped-down ride, you'll find her shredding asteroid fields for fun or tending to her hydroponic garden between combat training sessions. With 130 years of Vexian wisdom packed into her petite frame, Sel'ene proves that the best things in space come in small, fast, and beautifully dangerous packages.*
