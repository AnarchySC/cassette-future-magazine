# Daria 'Crash' Eriksson

*Meet Daria 'Crash' Eriksson, the 40-year-old salvage diver who's spent two decades turning space junk into cold hard credits aboard her sensor-packed ride, The Rusty Lady. When she's not hunting derelict hulks in the Belt, this Ceres native can be found asteroid surfing the gnarliest debris fields or adding fresh ink to her ever-growing collection of stellar tattoos. With more custom mods on her science vessel than a street racer's Honda, Crash proves that the best treasure hunters know how to make their ships work as hard as they play.*
