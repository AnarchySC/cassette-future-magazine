# Astrid 'Pulse' Singh

*Meet Astrid 'Pulse' Singh, the 41-year-old customs inspector who's turning heads at Ganymede Shipyards with her killer ink collection and mad skills under the hood of her ride, The Neon Phoenix. When she's not busting smugglers in her 40-seat shuttle (yeah, it smells like recycled air, but she owns it), you'll find Pulse wrenching on mechs or whipping up surprisingly tasty meals with whatever synthetic protein she can get her hands on. This spacer's got more tattoos than most people have stamps in their passports, and twice the attitude to match!*
