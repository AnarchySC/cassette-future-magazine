# Glyn'da Silva

*Meet Glyn'da Silva, the 340-year-old (but who's counting?) neural interface wizard from Sin City Station who's proof that you can have brains, beauty, and a ride that'll make you weep – her pristine beast "The Wild Kiss" packs more power than a supernova and looks twice as good. When she's not jacking cutting-edge tech into people's heads, this symbiotic stunner spends her downtime chatting up houseplants, preserving ancient alien dialects, and mastering the art of lucid dreaming (because apparently regular sleep is for amateurs). With skills sharper than a plasma cutter and a ship that screams "daddy's money but I earned the respect," Glyn'da's the kind of spacer who makes the impossible look effortless.*
