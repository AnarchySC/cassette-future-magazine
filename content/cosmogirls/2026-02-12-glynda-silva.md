# Glyn'da Silva

*Meet Glyn'da Silva, the pride of Mestag Moon's self-defense force and living proof that Turitek women are the most stunning creatures in the known galaxy. This senior gunner's mate may be petite, but her mocha skin decorated with traditional red ochre tattoos tells the story of a warrior who's earned every accolade. When she's not manning the defense batteries aboard The Wild Kiss, Glyn'da spends her time preserving the ancient languages of her people and perfecting the art of lucid dreaming - a Turitek meditation technique passed down through generations. Don't let her delicate features fool you; this genetically blessed beauty can outshoot any hotshot pilot in the sector.*
