# Nix'ara Hoang

*Meet Nix'ara Hoang, the 380-year-old Vexian bombshell who's flipping the script on what it means to be a badass bodyguard! When she's not throwing down in zero-G wrestling matches or keeping VIPs breathing at Weyland-Yutani HQ, you'll find this golden-eyed goddess slinging the sector's most legendary noodles from her ride, *The Midnight Lady* – because apparently protecting corporate suits works up an appetite for both danger and dumplings. Word on the docks is that Nix knows everyone's business thanks to her gossip network game, but hey, when you're crafting holographic masterpieces between beatdowns, you've got to stay entertained somehow!*
