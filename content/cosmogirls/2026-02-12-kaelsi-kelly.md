# Kael'si Kelly

*Meet Kael'si Kelly, the 289-year-old Zenari babe (that's 17 in her species' years!) who's got the galaxy's busiest jump gates running smoother than her plasma theremin skills. When she's not coordinating interstellar traffic or drilling asteroids with her beast of a mining ship, The Crimson Thunder, this blue-skinned beauty from Execution Platform unwinds with VR racing sims and her... unique hobby of consensually watching people sleep (hey, we don't judge!). With bioluminescent markings that probably glow brighter when she's tearing up the virtual tracks, Kael'si proves that the best things in space come in brilliantly blue packages.*
