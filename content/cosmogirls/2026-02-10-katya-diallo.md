# Katya Diallo

*Meet Katya Diallo, the 39-year-old spacer who's turning heads across the outer rim with her custom strike craft "The Rusty Kiss" – because apparently one shot, one kill never goes out of style. When she's not working as an off-world escort or crafting her signature pheromone blends, this Pirate's Cove native keeps busy with her uniquely intimate hobbies: predicting deaths (she's got a gift, trust us) and her totally-not-creepy consensual people-watching sessions. Equal parts mysterious and magnetic, Katya proves that the most dangerous rides come with the sweetest exhaust fumes.*
