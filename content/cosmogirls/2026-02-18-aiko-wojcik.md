# Aiko Wojcik

*Meet Aiko Wojcik, the 204-year-old Belter babe (that's 17 in spacer years!) who's making waves as an FTL nav specialist aboard her sick drone carrier, the Crimson Runner. When she's not deploying her fleet of 20 combat drones or plotting hyperspace jumps, this Babylon Station hottie keeps busy growing authentic coffee beans, creating rebellious protest art, and diving deep into her past lives. This multi-dimensional space goddess proves that navigating the cosmos and fighting the power can be done with serious style!*
