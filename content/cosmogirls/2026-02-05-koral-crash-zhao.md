# Kor'al 'Crash' Zhao

*Meet Kor'al 'Crash' Zhao, the green-skinned void fisher who's proving that Europa's ice fields breed the galaxy's coolest gearheads! When she's not pulling exotic catches from the cosmic deep with her sensor-packed ride *The Lucky Star*, this 29-year-old Kaelith can be found crushing retro arcade games or getting her hands dirty with some serious mech modifications in her hydroponic workshop. Fair warning though—her vine-like hair has a mind of its own, and it's been known to accidentally hit the hyperdrive when she gets too excited about a rare fish sighting!*
