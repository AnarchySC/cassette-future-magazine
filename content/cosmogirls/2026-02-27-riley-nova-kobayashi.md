# Riley 'Nova' Kobayashi

*Meet Riley "Nova" Kobayashi, the 31-year-old Belter babe who's turned pirate hunting into an art form while cruising the void in her souped-up rescue ship, *The Wild Lady*. When she's not chasing down space scumbags or saving stranded spacers, you'll find Nova burning up the drone racing circuits around Wolf 359 or fine-tuning her voice box mods to drop those silky smooth transmissions that make even hardened pirates think twice. This white-hat hacker proves that the best kind of trouble comes in a zero-g package with a heart of gold and reflexes faster than a fusion burn.*
