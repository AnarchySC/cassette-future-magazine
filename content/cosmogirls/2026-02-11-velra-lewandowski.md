# Vel'ra Lewandowski

*Meet Vel'ra Lewandowski, the 35-year-old Felinari firecracker who's trading asteroid surveys for adrenaline aboard her converted hospital ship, The Crimson Star! When she's not navigating the void with those signature slit-pupil reflexes, you'll find this Tycho City native perfecting her zero-G backflips or cultivating the galaxy's most gnarly weightless bonsai garden. This cat's got claws both in space and on canvas—her protest art pieces are causing as much buzz in the underground scene as her gymnastics routines are racking up views on the holonet.*
