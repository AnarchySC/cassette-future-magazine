# Glyn'da Silva

*Meet Glyn'da Silva, the 340-year-old baby-faced Symbian who's making waves installing neural interfaces while cruising the cosmos in her ridiculously overpowered ride, The Wild Kiss—think trust fund meets hyperdrive. When she's not plugging brains into starships or chatting up her houseplants in dead languages, you'll find this Sin City Station native perfecting her lucid dreaming skills between jobs. Don't let her youthful 20-something Symbian age fool you—this girl's got more personality than her pristine speedster has unused horsepower!*
