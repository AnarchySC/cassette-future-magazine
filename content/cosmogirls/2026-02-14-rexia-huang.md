# Rex'ia Huang

*Meet Rex'ia Huang, the 247-year-old Mothari hottie (that's 19 in moth years!) who's making waves across the galaxy with her sick ride, The Rusty Heart - a refrigerated cargo hauler that's definitely not just carrying medical supplies and gourmet grub, if you know what we mean. When she's not wheeling and dealing in the gray market arms trade from her home base at L1 Customs Station, this fuzzy-winged bombshell keeps busy building custom androids, tearing up the exotic dance scene, and indulging in her unique hobby of consensual sleep-watching (hey, we don't judge!). Rex'ia proves that the best things in space come with wings, attitude, and just a little bit of danger.*
