# Thessa Adeyemi

*Meet Thessa Adeyemi, the 16-year-old Arachni prodigy who's already mastering FTL nav on the passenger liner *Lucky Rose* – those extra eyes aren't just for show when you're plotting jumps for 200 sleeping passengers! When she's not charting courses between star systems, this Ganymede dome girl unwinds by cracking ancient codes and hand-drawing stellar cartography that puts most ship computers to shame. Word of advice: if you spot Thessa at a spaceport bar, she might not be who she seems – this spider's got more identities than a master spy and twice the attitude!*
