# Thessa Adeyemi

*Meet Thessa Adeyemi, the 16-year-old Arachni prodigy who's plotting hyperspace jumps for The Lucky Rose while most kids her age are still figuring out basic algebra! This multi-eyed navigation wizard from Ganymede's ag-domes spends her downtime cracking codes, sketching stellar cartography by hand (old school cool!), and pulling off identity switches smoother than a zero-G drift. When you're hauling 200 sleeping passengers across the galaxy, you better believe Thessa's eight eyes are keeping everyone on course and her web of fake IDs is keeping things interesting at every port of call.*
