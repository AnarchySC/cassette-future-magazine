# Yui Rao

*Meet Yui Rao, the 296-year-old Void-Born bombshell who's been spinning underground beats from her hijacked research vessel *The Dark Star* while her science crew tries to work around her epic eating competitions in the lab. When she's not dropping sick tracks across three sectors or hunting down cosmic anomalies for kicks, you'll find this pale-eyed space goddess literally painting nebulae while floating outside her ship—talk about taking your art seriously! This Babylon Station rebel proves that the best DJs are born in the void, aged to perfection, and absolutely fearless when it comes to mixing beats with the unknown.*
