# Katya Diallo

*Meet Katya Diallo, the 39-year-old off-world escort who's turning heads across the galaxy from her home base at Pirate's Cove. When she's not piloting her lightning-fast strike craft "The Rusty Kiss" on high-stakes runs, this Earth-born stunner keeps busy with some seriously unique hobbies—from crafting custom pheromone blends to her uncanny knack for predicting deaths (talk about a conversation starter!). With her "one shot, one kill, run away" philosophy and a mysterious charm that keeps clients coming back, Katya proves that the most dangerous women in space are also the most irresistible.*
