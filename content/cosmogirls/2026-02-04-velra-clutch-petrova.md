# Vel'ra 'Clutch' Petrova

*Meet Vel'ra "Clutch" Petrova, the 27-year-old welding wizard from Enceladus Water Station who proves that three wrecks definitely make a right – her frankenstein ride, The Silver Thunder, shouldn't fly according to physics, but somehow screams through space like a dream. When she's not torch-dancing metal into submission at the shipyards, you'll find this zero-G goddess collecting weird alien trinkets or schooling rookies at retro arcade games. Fair warning: challenge her to a dance-off in microgravity and prepare to get served!*
