# Val'kira 'Pulse' Park

*Meet Val'kira 'Pulse' Park, the 28-year-old Zenari welder whose bioluminescent tattoos glow as bright as her plasma torch at Io Sulfur Works! When she's not crafting custom hulls by day, this blue-skinned speed demon tears up VR racing circuits and chases the perfect nebula shot in her trusty courier *The Golden Lady*. Don't let her artistic side fool you though—Pulse can throw down in combat training just as hard as she throws sparks in the shipyard.*
