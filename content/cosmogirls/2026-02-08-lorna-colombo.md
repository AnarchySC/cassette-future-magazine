# Lor'na Colombo

*Meet Lor'na Colombo, the shadow-wreathed repo queen of Lacaille Industrial Park who's made a career out of liberating spoiled rich kids from their underappreciated rides—including her own pristine powerhouse, The Crimson Phoenix. When this 35-year-old Umbrani isn't busy chasing down paradox anomalies or setting up lovelorn AIs with their perfect matches, you'll find her floating in zero-G creating masterpiece body art that literally glows against her darkness-touched skin. She's proof that the best toys always end up in the hands of someone who knows how to really use them.*
