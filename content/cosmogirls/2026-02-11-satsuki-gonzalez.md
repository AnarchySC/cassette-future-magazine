# Satsuki Gonzalez

*Meet Satsuki Gonzalez, the 288-year-old (but don't let that fool you—she's only 16 in Void-Born years!) AI whisperer cruising the galaxy in her tricked-out long-hauler, The Dark Thunder. When she's not busy fixing broken artificial minds or schooling aliens at poker with her unreadable pale features, you'll find this Babylon Station native chowing down on sketchy alien street food and dominating 4D chess matches across three dimensions. This girl's got the whole "mysterious spacer with a heart of gold" thing locked down!*
