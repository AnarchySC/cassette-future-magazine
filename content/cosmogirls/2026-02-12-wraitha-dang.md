# Wraith'a Dang

*Meet Wraith'a Dang, the 19-year-old Avirix influencer who's turning heads across the galaxy with her sick bioluminescent ink and a passenger liner she calls home! When she's not busy posting content from The Wild Lady's 200 cryo-berths or tending to her pet space whales, this feathered beauty from Io Radiation Labs is on the ultimate quest to find the legendary lost planet Earth. With talons as sharp as her style and a personality that's absolutely stellar, Wraith'a proves that being 152 in bird years just means you've got more time to perfect your glow-up!*
