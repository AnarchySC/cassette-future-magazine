# Raven 'Ace' Volkov

*Meet Raven "Ace" Volkov, the 31-year-old torch queen who's been welding dreams into reality at Io Sulfur Works while piloting her trusty colony shuttle, The Lucky Dream—a 40-seater that she swears runs on recycled air and pure determination. When she's not busy making sparks fly in the shipyard, this Earth-born badass can be found whipping up gourmet meals from synthetic proteins, hunting down rare alien artifacts, or throwing down in combat training sessions that would make a space marine sweat. With callused hands and a heart full of wanderlust, Ace proves that the best adventures start with a girl, her ship, and the endless black between the stars.*
