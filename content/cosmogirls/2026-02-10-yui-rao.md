# Yui Rao

*Meet Yui Rao, the 37-year-old void-born DJ whose pirate radio broadcasts from The Dark Star have made her the hottest voice in deep space—when she's not busy out-eating space truckers at competitive eating contests or literally painting nebulae while floating inside them. This anomaly-hunting mama has turned a nerdy research vessel into the galaxy's most unconventional radio station, beaming beats and banter across the cosmos from her home base at Babylon Station. At 296 in void-born years, Yui's got the wisdom of the universe and the appetite to match, making her the spacer girl everyone wants to party with in the outer rim.*
