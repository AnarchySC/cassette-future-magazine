# Zara 'Viper' Volkov

*Meet Zara 'Viper' Volkov, the 34-year-old adrenaline junkie who trades asteroid dust by day and throws down in underground fight rings by night! This Io Sulfur Works native pilots "The Wild Kiss" – a frankenstein beauty born from three salvaged wrecks that somehow defies physics and still hauls serious cargo through the belt. When she's not cracking rocks or cracking skulls, you'll find Viper burning rubber in VR racing sims, because apparently regular danger just isn't enough for this cosmic speed demon.*
