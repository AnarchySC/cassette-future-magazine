# Thessa 'Nova' Tanaka

*Meet Thessa "Nova" Tanaka, the 28-year-old Rylani bounty hunter who's trading cargo runs for chase scenes across the galaxy! When she's not hauling refinery platforms with her crew aboard *The Golden Rose*, this red-skinned badass is busy souping up mechs in her downtime and blasting vintage Earth rock while tracking down the sector's most wanted. With her horns, tail, and take-no-prisoners attitude, Nova proves that the best hunters come in the most unexpected packages!*
