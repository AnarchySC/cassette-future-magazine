# Luna 'Viper' Andersen

*Meet Luna "Viper" Andersen, the 35-year-old smuggler who's been outrunning authorities across three star systems in her ride, The Sweet Lightning—a tricked-out science vessel packed with enough sensor arrays to make a spy jealous, even if there's barely room to stretch your legs. When she's not dodging customs agents or moving questionable cargo through the Thedus Refinery, this retro-loving speed demon can be found perfecting her combat skills, crushing vintage arcade games, or cranking up some classic Earth rock that's older than most of her clients. With reflexes as sharp as her ship's sensors and a taste for the finer things from humanity's golden age, Viper proves that the best smugglers blend old-school style with cutting-edge tech.*
