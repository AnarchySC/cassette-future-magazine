# Cel'wyn Nielsen

*Meet Cel'wyn Nielsen, the 40-year-old Sethrani who's making waves across the galaxy with her ride, The Dark Lightning—a sleek beacon tender that's as mysterious as its serpentine owner. When she's not hunting down insurance scammers with that razor-sharp forked tongue of hers, you'll find this scaled speed demon prowling through ship graveyards, chatting up AIs like old friends, and upgrading herself with the latest cybernetic mods. With 320 Sethrani years of attitude packed into her coils and a home base at Pinnacle Station, Cel'wyn proves that the best investigators know how to navigate both the lonely void and the shadiest corners of the spacer scene.*
