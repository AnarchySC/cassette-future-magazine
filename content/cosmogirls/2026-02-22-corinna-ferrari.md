# Cor'inna Ferrari

*Meet Cor'inna Ferrari, the furry force of nature who makes forgetting look good! This 40-year-old Ursari beauty pilots her beast of a ship, The Midnight Rose, between memory wipe gigs at Red Light Orbital, but when she's off the clock, you'll find her chasing bounties for kicks or creating mind-bending neural art that'll scramble your circuits in the best way possible. With the strength to crush steel and a zen master's calm from meditating at event horizons, Cor'inna proves that sometimes the most dangerous package comes wrapped in the fluffiest fur.*
