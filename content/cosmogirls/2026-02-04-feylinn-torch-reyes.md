# Fey'linn 'Torch' Reyes

*Meet Fey'linn 'Torch' Reyes, the 25-year-old Kaelith customs inspector who's turning heads at Enceladus Water Station with her tricked-out industrial hauler, The Wild Runner. When she's not busting smugglers with those keen plant-hybrid senses, you'll find this green goddess whipping up killer synthetic protein dishes, snapping jaw-dropping nebula shots, or wrenching on her ride's mag-lock cargo system. Don't let that government job fool you—Torch's got more mods under her hood than most racers, and her vine-like hair changes color when she's about to catch you red-handed!*
