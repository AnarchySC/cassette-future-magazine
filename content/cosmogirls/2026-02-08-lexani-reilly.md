# Lex'ani Reilly

*Meet Lex'ani Reilly, the 456-year-old Felinari firecracker who's got those hypnotic slit pupils and enough attitude to power a dreadnought! When she's not chasing down cosmic anomalies in her tricked-out station hopper "The Lucky Dream," this No Law Zone 7 native is either organizing union strikes, throwing down serious credits at high-stakes tables, or mapping systems that don't officially exist. Fair warning: this cat's got claws, and she's not afraid to use them whether she's negotiating worker contracts or navigating uncharted space!*
