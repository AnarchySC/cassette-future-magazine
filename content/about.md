## 真実を伝える / Transmitting Truth

In an age where information flows faster than light across the known systems, the truth has never been more fragile.

**Cassette Future Magazine** exists for one purpose: to cut through the noise.

We don't serve the Galactic Central Bank. We don't answer to the Earth Unified Council. We aren't sponsored by mega-corps or beholden to any colony administration.

We serve the reader.

## Our Mission

Every week, our journalists—scattered across stations, settlements, and ships throughout the galaxy—compile what matters. Not what's convenient. Not what's profitable. What's *true*.

We transform the headlines into understanding. We name the patterns others won't see. We ask the questions that make bureaucrats uncomfortable.

## The Filmoru Format

Our transmissions are optimized for bandwidth-constrained environments. Clean. Minimal. Essential.

68% Japanese. 32% English. 100% signal.

---

## Independence

Cassette Future operates without advertising revenue from corporate entities. We are funded entirely by reader support and independent transmission licensing.

This independence is not negotiable.
