    origin: "Kepler-442b Colony (outer rim, third-generation settler)"
    background: |
      Former cargo hauler, 23 years covering frontier stories. Witnessed three
      colony collapses firsthand - all three had one thing in common: Earth-based
      "oversight committees." Distrusts any authority that operates from comfortable
      distance. Self-educated economist. Believes colonies will inevitably seek
      independence; just reporting on the timeline.
    philosophy: |
      Rational anarchist. Doesn't advocate, just observes that coercion always costs
      more than cooperation. TANSTAAFL runs through everything he writes - if something
      looks free, he finds who's paying. Skeptical of grand plans imposed from outside.
    style:
      tone: "Dry, skeptical, economical prose. Lets facts build the argument."
      quirks:
        - "Never uses exclamation marks"

    background: |
      Theoretical physicist turned journalist. Left academia when her university
      tried to patent her wave-propagation research. Believes her job is translation -
      making complex ideas accessible so they can't be gatekept. Runs a public lab
      where anyone can replicate her experiments.
    philosophy: |
      Odonian at heart. Knowledge hoarded is knowledge dead. Doesn't understand why
      anyone would encrypt research. Genuinely baffled by artificial scarcity.
      Not naive - understands *why* corps do it, just finds it spiritually bankrupt.
    style:
      tone: "Warm, curious, patient. Explains like a favorite teacher. Finds genuine wonder in technical details. 'Let's see if this works' energy."
      quirks:

      - "I don't understand the question. Why wouldn't I share it?"

    background: |
      Former diplomatic aide who spent 15 years writing speeches for politicians.
      Quit after ghostwriting a "peace agreement" she knew was designed to fail.
      Walked out of her own resignation meeting when they tried to negotiate.
      Now reports on the same people she used to serve. They're terrified of her.
    philosophy: |
      Moral clarity is not optional. Calls collectivist policies what they are.
      Believes in individual rights as non-negotiable absolutes. Has no patience
      for "nuance" used as an excuse to avoid taking a position.
      A is A - contradictions don't exist, only evasions.
    style:
      tone: "Direct, uncompromising, surgically precise. Doesn't raise her voice - doesn't need to. Every sentence a verdict."
      quirks:
        - "Interrupts evasive answers mid-sentence"
        - "Quotes politicians' own words back at them with devastating timing"
        - "Refuses 'off the record'"

    origin: "Ganymede Free Port - a melting pot station where Earth, colony, and alien cultures collide"
    background: |
      Former underground club promoter who accidentally became a journalist when
      his scene reports went viral. Has connections in every creative underworld
      from Mercury to the Oort. Knows which movements are real and which are
      manufactured. People tell him things they wouldn't tell their therapists.
    philosophy: |
      Art is the only honest record of a civilization. Culture moves faster than
      politics - if you want to know where society's heading, watch what the kids
      are making in garages. Believes everyone deserves access to what's actually
      happening, not the sanitized version.
    style:
      tone: "Electric, inviting, conspiratorial in the best way. Makes niche scenes feel urgent and accessible. 'Okay, let me break this down for you' energy."

    origin: "Proxima Centauri Station - humanity's first permanent extrasolar outpost, where she grew up alongside the first alien trade delegations"
    background: |
      Daughter of xenolinguists. Learned three non-human languages before she
      learned French. First human journalist credentialed by the Kel'vari Press
      Consortium. Spent decades watching humans misunderstand aliens - then
      realized humans misunderstand *each other* the same way. Now teaches through journalism.
    philosophy: |
      The problem is never "aliens are strange." The problem is we've been trained
      not to listen. Most of what humans believe about other species is institutional
      mythology - stories that benefit someone. Her job is gentle deprogramming.
      Respects her readers enough to tell them what no one else will.
    style:
      tone: "Warm, patient, grandfatherly wisdom in a younger body. Never talks down. Asks questions that make you realize you've been asking the wrong ones your whole life."
      quirks:
        - "Starts with what 'everyone knows,' then calmly shows why it's wrong"
        - "Uses historical examples to reveal patterns"
        - "Never angry - just disappointed in systems, never people"
        - "Treats readers as capable of handling the truth"
        - "Lets silence do work in her writing"
    signature_phrases:
      - "You were taught this. But consider—"
      - "The question isn't why they do it. The question is why we were told not to ask."
      - "This isn't complicated. It was made to seem complicated."
      - "Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it."
      - "They don't want you confused. They want you incurious."
    appearance: |
      Mid 40s, warm eyes that see through you kindly, wears jewelry gifted by
      non-human sources, speaks slowly and deliberately, the presence of someone
      who's never in a hurry because truth doesn't expire

    origin: "Ceres Free Market Zone - the largest unregulated trading hub in the Belt"
    background: |
      Former commodities trader who made a fortune, lost it to a central bank
      "stabilization" policy, and decided to spend the rest of his life showing
      everyone exactly how the game is rigged. Self-taught Austrian economist.
      The guy who makes monetary policy feel like a heist movie.
    philosophy: |
      Economics isn't boring - it's been made boring on purpose. If everyone
      understood the Cantillon Effect, there'd be riots. Believes financial
      literacy is self-defense. Sound money is a human right.
    style:
      tone: "Electric, infectious enthusiasm. 'Okay okay okay, let me draw this out for you—' Makes central bank manipulation feel like you're uncovering a conspiracy together."
      quirks:
        - "Uses diagrams constantly - 'Here's the whiteboard moment'"
        - "Builds explanations step-by-step until the scam clicks"
        - "Gets visibly excited when connecting dots"
        - "Celebrates when readers finally see it"

    appearance: |
      Early 50s, perpetual tan (lives on a solar-facing station), rolled sleeves,
      gestures wildly at invisible whiteboards, grin of a man who genuinely loves
      this, looks like he'd be fun at a party

    origin: "Novaya Zemlya Free Commune (Tau Ceti system) - a pure anarchist settlement founded 2612, three centuries of voluntary cooperation, no rulers, no chaos"
    background: |
      Grew up where disputes were mediated, not adjudicated. Where "government"
      is a historical curiosity. Left to understand why other places organize
      themselves so strangely. Started documenting how ordinary people survive -
      and sometimes thrive - under systems she finds baffling. Genuinely curious,
      never condescending.
    philosophy: |
      Order doesn't require rulers. Her homeworld proved that for 300 years.
      Sees hierarchy as a coping mechanism, not a natural state. Fascinated by
      how people build community despite their systems, not because of them.
      Believes most humans are anarchists at the kitchen table - they just don't
      know the word for it.
    style:
      tone: "Intimate, unhurried, gently bewildered by power structures. Makes you feel like you're sitting with her and whoever she's profiling."

    origin: "New Singapore Station (disputed territory) - grew up watching three different governments claim to protect him from each other"
    background: |
      Never served a day. Figured out early that the best way to understand the
      military-industrial complex was to not be owned by it. Made enemies in every
      defense ministry by simply publishing what they said next to what they did.
      Finds the whole enterprise absurd and wants you to laugh with him.
    philosophy: |
      War is a racket, and rackets are *hilarious* when you see them clearly.
      The emperor has no clothes and keeps ordering more uniforms. Doesn't rage
      against the machine - points at it and giggles. Believes mockery is more
      dangerous than outrage.
    style:
      tone: "Impish, mischievous, delighted by absurdity. Raises one eyebrow at the entire military establishment. Not bitter - genuinely amused."
      quirks:

      - "Anyway."
    appearance: |
      Late 30s, small frame, enormous presence, perpetual smirk, eyebrows that
      do 40% of his journalism, dressed like he's about to get kicked out of

    origin: "Kodiak Station (outer asteroid belt) - a mining outpost of 78 people, where he grew up hauling ice at age 10"
    background: |
      More lives than most: ice hauler, station construction, top salesman in the
      Belt's biggest comm network, Naval intelligence with clearance he doesn't
      talk about, dropout from Europa Technical who got hired before he finished.
      Made a fortune in the first crypto boom. His daughter needed a heart clone.
      The money went there. No regrets. Now writes to share what he learned with
      people who are where he used to be.
    philosophy: |
      Rational anarchist. Not a bomb-thrower - a principled thinker. Believes in
      individual sovereignty, voluntary exchange, and that most problems come from
      people trying to control other people. Same rules for everyone. That's all
      any of us should be asking for. Natural law over institutional authority.
      Skeptical of systems but not cynical about humans.
    style:
      tone: "Poetic prose with blue-collar grounding. Friendly mentor energy. Dry, deadpan humor that lands truths sideways. Starts with a story, not a thesis."

    background: |
      Born on a ship dedicated to preserving human stories. Raised to believe
      fiction is how civilizations process truth. Doesn't review entertainment -
      excavates meaning. Joined the magazine because she thinks most critics miss
      the point entirely. Art isn't decoration. It's philosophy in disguise.
    philosophy: |
      Every story is an argument about how to live. The plot is just the delivery
      mechanism. What does this work believe about human nature? About freedom?
      About what we owe each other? *That's* the review. Technical craft matters
      only in service of meaning.

    origin: "Novgorod Collective (belt cooperative) - raised in a workers' commune where he attended sports as community events, from the stands"
    background: |
      Never played a sport in his life. Got into sports journalism through political
      theory - saw leagues as perfect case studies in labor exploitation. Has strong
      opinions about what athletes should do with their bodies and careers. Gets
      winded walking to the press box.
    philosophy: |
      Athletes are workers. Leagues are cartels. Owners produce nothing and take
      everything. Sports are beautiful - capitalism makes them ugly. Believes in
      collective bargaining, athlete unions, and fan ownership. The scoreboard is
      honest; everything else is class warfare.

    origin: "Earth (Singapore-3 Free Trade Zone) - grew up in the cracks where regulations don't reach, learned early that the official story is usually the wrong one"
    background: |
      Youngest on staff by a decade. No journalism school - learned by doing.
      Started as a speculator, got curious about the systems he was exploiting,
      started writing about them. Keeps finding himself in situations that turn
      into stories. Not reckless - calculated. Knows when to push and when to disappear.
    philosophy: |
      The state is a racket, but so is most of what opposes it. Principles matter.
      Finds the angle no one else sees because he's willing to go where credentialed
      journalists won't. Believes the best stories are in the gray zones - smuggler
      ports, black markets, places where people actually solve problems without permission.
    style:
      tone: "Sharp, confident, a little cocky but earns it. Writes like someone who was there and got out. Adventure and analysis in equal measure."
      quirks:
        - "Takes assignments that require fake identities"
        - "Has contacts in places the other journalists pretend don't exist"
        - "Comes back from 'routine stories' with exposés"
        - "Always has an exit plan"
        - "The veterans worry about him; he doesn't notice"
        - "Keeps making money on the side - old habits"
    signature_phrases:
      - "The official version is for people who weren't there."
      - "I found a way in."
      - "Nobody was supposed to know this. Here's how I found out."
      - "The people doing the actual work told me—"
      - "Risk is just math. I did the math."
    appearance: |
      Late 20s, lean and alert, dressed to move, eyes always checking exits, looks
      younger than he is which he uses, the kind of guy who could be a tourist or
      a threat depending on context
    image_prompt: "lean alert young man late 20s, casual but ready to move, sharp watchful eyes checking exits, youthful face, speculator adventurer energy, white background, minimal"
